<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">First</span>, M. de Montaigne.—When Montaigne
found himself feeling old and ill, in
1580, he made up his mind to try the baths
of Germany and Italy. So he set out; and returned
in 1581. And sometimes the baths did him good
and sometimes they made no difference; but the
journeying never failed to do what the baths were
meant for. He always, he says, found forgetfulness
of his age and infirmities in travelling. However
restless at night, he was alert in the morning,
if the morning meant starting for somewhere
fresh. Compared with Montaigne at home, Montaigne
abroad never got tired or fretful; always
in good spirits, always interested in everything,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>and ready for a talk with the first man he met. And
when his companions suggested that they would
like to get to the journey's end, and that the longest
way round, which he preferred, had its disadvantages,
especially when it was a bye-road leading
back to the place they started from, he would say,
that he never set out for anywhere particular;
that he had not gone out of the way, because his
way lay through unfamiliar places, and the only
place he wished to avoid was where he had been
before or where he had to stop. And that he felt
as one who was reading some delightful tale and
dreaded to come upon the last page.</p>

<p>So, no doubt, felt Fynes Moryson, for much of
his life he spent either in travelling or in writing
the record of it. Starting in 1591, when he was
twenty-five, he passed through Germany, the
Low Countries, Denmark, Poland, Austria, Switzerland,
and Italy, spending his winters at Leipzig,
Leyden, Padua, and Venice, learning the languages
so thoroughly as to be able to disguise his
nationality at will. Returning through France,
he was robbed, and consequently reached home
so disreputable-looking that the servant took him
for a burglar. He found his brother planning a
journey to Jerusalem. On the 29th of November,
1595, they set out, and on July 10, 1597, he was
back in London, in appearance again so strange
that the Dogberry of Aldersgate Street wrote him
down for a Jesuit. But he returned alone: his brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Henry, twenty-six years old and not strong,
fell ill at Aleppo, how ill no one knew till too late,
and near Iskenderún he died in his brother's arms,
while the Turks stood round, jeering and thieving.
Fynes buried him there with stones above
him to keep off the jackals, and an epitaph which
a later traveller by chance has preserved.<a name="Anchor-1" id="Anchor-1"></a><a href="#Footnote-1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

     <div class="verse">For monuments and all must die.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Fynes himself hurried home and never crossed
the Channel again. But he extended his knowledge
of Great Britain by a visit to Scotland, and
by accompanying Sir Charles Blount during the
latter's conquest of Ireland. Then he settled down
to write all he knew and could get to know about
the countries he had seen, and wrote at such length
that no one till quite recently has had the courage
to reprint his account, although what he
printed was by no means all that he wrote. For
this reason his work has remained practically unused,
even by writers whom it specially concerns.
It must form the basis of any description of the
countries he saw, at any rate, as seen by a foreigner,
going, as he does, more into detail than
any one else, and being a thoroughly fair-minded,
level-headed, and well-educated man, whose knowledge
was the result of experience. His day was
not the day of the 'Grand Tourist,' whose habit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>it was to disguise single facts as general statements,
and others' general statements as his own
experiences.</p>

<p>Yet however irreplaceable may be Montaigne's
subjectivity and Moryson's objectivity, it is desirable
to find some one who combines both. Such
a one is Pietro della Valle, of Naples and Rome.
He is the impersonation of contemporary Italy
at its best; of, to use his own phrase, "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">quella
civiltà di vivere e quello splendore all' italiana</span>,"
and to read his letters is to realise, as in no other
way can be so readily realised, the reason why
Italy held the position she did in the ideas of
sixteenth-century people. If you separate the
various characteristics that account for much of
the attractiveness of his writings; the interest
in things small and great, without triviality or
ponderousness; the ability to write, combined
with entire freedom from affectation; the lovableness
of his Italian and a charm of phrase apart
from his Italian, which might even, perhaps, survive
translation; learning without arrogance and
hand in hand with observation; and refinement
and virility living in him as a single quality—if
you isolate these, there still remains something
to distinguish him from contemporary travellers,
the product of gifts and character, it is true,
but only of gifts and character as moulded by
contact from birth with the best of a splendid
civilisation, of which all the gentlemen of Europe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
were students, but none but natives graduates.</p>

<p>Still, in one respect, contemporary travellers
may claim he has taken an unfair advantage. Not
one of them has a romantic love-story as a background
to his journeyings; Della Valle has two.
After a twelve years' courtship at home, his intended
bride was given by her parents to some
one else. This was the cause of his wanderings.
At San Marcellino at Naples, a mass was sung
and the nuns prayed, the little golden pilgrim's
staff he wore round his neck was blessed, and a
vow made by him never to take it off until he
had visited the Holy Sepulchre.</p>

<p>Thus he became Pietro della Valle, "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Il Pellegrino</span>"
(the Pilgrim); and started. Venice, Constantinople,
Cairo, Jerusalem, Damascus, was
his route; but his next letter thereafter is "from
my tent in the desert": he has disappeared over
the tourist horizon, and become a traveller on the
grand scale. But he returns, and has much to say
on the way back. Meanwhile, in Babylon, he has
met another lady-love, Maani Gioerida, eighteen
years old, daughter of an Assyrian father and an
Armenian mother. Marriage with her was soon
followed by her death; for the remaining four
years of his wanderings he carried her body with
him, laying it to rest in the end in his family tomb:
and married again, this time the girl who had
attended his first wife, alive and dead, Maria
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>Tinatin di Ziba, a Georgian. And with her he lived
happy ever after, and by her had fourteen sons.</p>

<p>Another type of traveller is the philosopher
philosophizing. Sir Henry Blount set four particular
aims before himself when he started for
southeastern Europe with the intention of increasing
his knowledge of things human, choosing
the southeast because the west too closely resembled
England. He went to note, first, the
characteristics of "the religion, manners, and
policy of the Turks" in so far as these threw light
on the question whether they were, as reputed,
barbarous, or possessed of a different variety of
civilisation. Secondly, to satisfy the interest he
felt in the subject-races, especially Jews; thirdly,
to study the Turkish army about to set out for
Poland; and fourthly, Cairo, which being the
largest city existing, or on record, had problems
of its own whose solutions he wished to note, much
as foreigners might come to study London County
Council doings now. This was in 1634.</p>

<p>But besides those who were born travellers and
those who achieved travel, there were those who
had travel thrust upon them; Thomas Dallam,
for instance. Dallam was the master organ-builder
of Elizabethan England. When, therefore,
the Queen wished to send such a present to
the Grand Turk as should assure her outshining
all other sovereigns in his eyes and assist the
Levant Company (who probably paid for it) in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>securing further privileges, an organ was the present,
and Dallam had to make it and to take it.
In 1599 he set out, and in 1600 praised God for
his return. He, too, was an excellent Englishman:
shrewd, interested, and interesting; and with
an ability to express himself just abreast of his
thinking faculty. His organ was a marvellous
creation; played chimes, and song-tunes by itself,
had two dummy-men on it who fanfared on silver
trumpets, and, above, an imitation holly-bush
filled with mechanical birds which sang and
shook their wings. The Grand Turk sent for
Dallam to play on it, which he did rather nervously,
having been warned that it meant death
to touch the Signor, and the latter sat so near
behind him that "I touched his knee with my
breeches.... He sat so right behind me that he
could not see what I did, therefore he stood up,
but in his rising from his chair, he gave me a
thrust forward, which he could not otherwise do,
he sat so near me: but I thought he had been
drawing his sword to cut off my head."</p>

<p>The organ was so great a success that Dallam
became a favoured man. One attendant even let
him look in at a grating through which he saw
thirty of the girls of the harem playing ball, each
wearing a chain of pearls round the neck, a ring of
gold round the ankle, velvet slippers, a small cap
of cloth of gold, breeches of the finest muslin, and
a scarlet satin jacket.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>Dallam was more in favour than he liked, for he
was urged to settle there. "I answered them that
I had a wife and children in England who did
expect my return, though indeed I had neither
wife nor children, yet to excuse myself I made
them that answer."</p>

<p>Besides the business man who became a tourist
without knowing it, there were the tourists who
became so because home was too hot for them. Of
their number was William Lithgow, whose "Rare
Adventures" is the record of nineteen years'
travel, ended in 1620 by the severity of the torture
he endured in Spain through being taken for a
spy. Although fifty years of age when he started
writing his account, a fair sample of his style is,—"Here
in Argos I had the ground to be a pillow,
and the world-wide fields to be a chamber, the
whirling windy skies to be a roof to my winter-blasted
lodging, the humid vapours of cold Nocturna
to accompany the unwished-for bed of my
repose." And this was accompanied by so much
second-hand history and doggerel that the printer
rebelled and saved us from much more of it. The
trustworthiness of his facts may be gauged by his
stating as the result of his personal experience
that Scotland is one hundred and twenty miles
longer than England. On the other hand, he visited
more places in Europe than any other one
tourist, besides having some experience of Palestine
and North Africa; and what he wrote he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>wrote after he had seen all that he did see. His
comparisons are, therefore, worth attention, and
these and the personal experiences which his
verbiage has not crowded out of his book give it a
permanent value and interest to those who have
the patience to find them.</p>

<p>All this while we are forgetting the ladies; very
few in number, but three at least possessing personality,—two
princesses and an ambassador's
wife. Princess number one was the eldest daughter
of Philip <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> of Spain, the Infanta Doña Clara
Eugenia, who crossed Europe with her husband,
to take up the government of the Low Countries,
in 1599, and wrote a long letter to her brother
about the journey from Milan to Brussels, bright
and pithy, one of the most readable and sensible
letters that remain to us from the sixteenth century.
Princess number two is the daughter of a
king of Sweden, who had trouble in finding a husband
for Princess Cecily, inasmuch as she would
marry no one who would not promise to take her
to England within a year from the wedding day;
for the great desire of her life was to see Queen
Elizabeth. A marquis of Baden accepted the condition,
and on November 12, 1564, they started, by
which time she had spent four years learning English
and could speak it well. The voyage took ten
months, the winter was a severe one, and much of
their way lay through countries whose kings were
hostile to her father and the inhabitants to every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>stranger. Leaving Stockholm while her relatives
expressed their opinion about her journey by
lamentations and fainting-fits, she crossed to Finland
in a storm, in which the pilot lost heart to the
extent of pointing out the rock on which they were
going to be shipwrecked. Finland they left in four
days, to escape starvation, during another storm;
crossed to Lithuania; thence by land through
Poland, North Germany, and Flanders, to Calais.
Even from here it was not plain sailing, in any
sense of the words; the sea was high when she
started; all were sick ("with the cruel surges of
the water and the rolling of the unsavoury ship"),
except herself, standing on the hatches, looking
towards England. But it proved impossible to get
into Dover and they had to turn back. "'Alas!'
quoth she, 'now must I needs be sick, both in body
and in mind,' and therewith taking her cabin,
waxed wonderful sick." A second time they tried;
and again all were sick but herself; "she sitting
always upon the hatches, passed the time in singing
the English psalms of David after the English
note and ditty." But again they had to turn back
and again that made her sick, so sick that they
thought she was going to be confined, for she had
become pregnant about the time of her starting.
A third attempt was successful; and on September
11, 1565, she arrived at Bedford House,
Strand; on the 14th Queen Elizabeth arrived there,
too, to see her; and on the 15th came the baby.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>This story ought to end like Della Valle's, that she
lived happy ever after; but that cannot truthfully
be said, because of what is recorded about Princess
Cecily and certain unpaid London tradesmen.
Much more would there be to say of her as a tourist,
had she written an autobiography; for the rest
of her life she continued travelling, spending all
her own money on it and much of other people's.</p>

<p>The third, the ambassador's wife, is Ann, Lady
Fanshawe. Her travels belong, strictly speaking,
to dates just outside the limits (1542-1642) with
which this book is concerned, but for all practical
purposes may be referred to with little reserve.
Her experience was great, for her journeys were
even more numerous than her pregnancies, which
numbered eighteen; and being cheerful, clear-headed,
and sincere in no ordinary measure, her
"Memoirs" are almost as excellent a record of
travel as of character.</p>

<p>It is a matter for regret that her husband, Sir
Richard, has not left us an account of his own, but
in this he resembles practically all his kind. There
is Sir Robert Sherley, who went ambassador to
two Emperors, two Popes, twice to Spain, twice
to Poland, once to Russia, twice to Persia: yet of
Sir Robert Sherley as tourist, we know next to
nothing. So also of Sir Paul Pindar, who says in a
letter that he has had eighteen years' experience
of Italy; and De Foix, a man greatly gifted, who
wished to serve his country as far as possible distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
from its Valois Kings, and consequently chose
a series of embassies as an honourable, useful
form of self-exile. Yet of these last two and others
there remains some record by means of men who
accompanied them. Part of the travels of Peter
Mundy, whose name will often recur, happened in
the train of the former; and when De Thou, the
historian, paid the visit to Italy which he recounts
in his autobiography, it was with De Foix that he
went.</p>

<p>Among the exceptions, most noticeable is
Augier Ghiselin de Busbecq, a Fleming. After
representing the Emperor in England at the wedding
of Philip and Mary, he was sent to Constantinople
(1556-1562), and afterwards to France. His
letters from France that have been preserved are
semi-official; of minor interest compared with
those from Constantinople, which, not meant for
publication but addressed to friends who were
worthy of them, in time became printed. They
belong to the literature of middle age, that which
is written by men of fine character and fine education
when successful issues out of many trials
have made them wise and left them young. A
many-sided man: the library at Vienna is the
richer for his presents to the Emperor; many are
the stories he tells of the wild animals he kept
to while away the hours of the imprisonment
which he, ambassador as he was, had to endure;
the introducer into Europe of lilac, tulips, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>syringa; a collector of coins when such an occupation
was not usual as a hobby. His opportunities,
indeed, were such as occur no more; in Asia
Minor coins one thousand years old were in daily
use as weights; and yet Busbecq missed one
chance, for a brazier to whom he was referred
regretted he had not met him a few days earlier,
when he had had a vessel full of old coins which he
had just melted down to make kettles.</p>

<p>Turning from the personalities to the causes of
travel, we find that the class to which Busbecq
belonged, that of resident ambassador, was of
recent growth, and that it, and the tendencies of
which it is one symptom, are responsible for
creating the whole of the motives and the facilities
for travel which characterise journeyings of
this time as something different in kind from
those which preceded them. The custom of maintaining
resident representatives was developed in
Italy during the fifteenth century, but it did not
spread to the rest of civilised Europe till near the
beginning of the next; German research, indeed,
has even narrowed down the dates within which it
established itself as an international system to
1494-1497.<a name="Anchor-2" id="Anchor-2"></a><a href="#Footnote-2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a> The change was partly due to the
consolidation of sovereignties, which increased
the distances to be traversed between neighbour-princes,
partly to the insight of the three great
rulers who achieved the consolidations,—Ferdinand
of Aragon, Louis <abbr title="the eleventh">XI</abbr>, and Henry <abbr title="the seventh">VII</abbr>, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>abandoned the idea of force and isolation as the
only possible policies, and attempted to gain the
advantages, and avoid the disadvantages, of both
by means of ambassadors. Henry <abbr title="the seventh">VII</abbr> regarded
them as in no way differing from spies; the most
efficient kind of spies, from the point of view of
the sender; and unavoidable, from that of the receiver.
The latter's only remedy, Henry <abbr title="the seventh">VII</abbr>
thought, was to send two for every one received.
This alone, regarded, as it must be, considering
who the speaker was, as indicating what the practice
of the future would be, suffices to explain,
even to prove, a great increase in diplomatic movements.
But what further compels the deduction
is that the foregoing is reported by Comines, who
was probably, next to Francesco Guicciardini,
the most frequently read historian throughout the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Side by side with these official spies was the
secret service; bound to grow in proportion to the
increase among the former, implying a certain
cosmopolitanism in its members, which, again,
implies touring. This class of tourists is naturally
the least communicative of all, but so far as England
alone is concerned, if the history of the growth
of the English spy-system between Thomas and
Oliver Cromwell ever comes to be written, it is
bound to reveal an enormous number of men,
continually on the move for such purposes, or
qualifying themselves for secret service by previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
travel. And while there is a certain amount
of information concerning tourists and touring
to be gathered, in scraps, among State Papers
which concern spies as spies, there is a great deal
available, often first-hand, from them during
this period of probation. Many, also, would be
termed spies by their enemies and news-writers
by their friends; persons who are abroad for some
other, more or less genuine, reason, whose information
was very welcome to those at home in
the absence of newspapers, and was often paid
for by politicians who could acquire a greater hold
on the attention of those in power by means of
knowledge which was exclusive during a period
when the Foreign Office of a government existed
in a far less definitely organised form than at
present. It was in the course of such a mission
that Edmund Spenser saw most of Europe and
gained that intimate knowledge of contemporary
politics which gives his poems a value which
would have been more generally recognised had
not their value as poetry overshadowed other
merits. The traveller, then, still fulfilled what had
been his chief use to humanity in mediæval times,
that of a "bearer of tydynges," as Chaucer insists
often enough in his "House of Fame."</p>

<p>It is worth while turning back to Chaucer's
time to see how far the classes of travellers then
existing have their counterparts in 1600, and how
far not. Omitting students and artizans, as not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>varying, the types to be met on the road then may
be collected into those of commerce, pilgrimage,
vagabondage, and knight-errantry.</p>

<p>With regard to commerce, it may safely be
guessed that the absence of the modern inventions
for communication at a distance implied, in 1600
as in Chaucer's day, a greater proportional number
of journeys in person than at present: and the
enormous extension of commerce involved in the
discoveries of sea-routes must have involved an
increase in commercial traffic within Europe. As
for the particular forms of trade that were responsible
for taking men away from their homes,
within the limits of Europe, it would probably be
found, if statistics were possible, that dried fish
came first, with wine and corn bracketed second.
The Roman Catholic fast-days had produced a
habit of eating dried fish which was not to be
shaken off, in the strictest Protestant quarters,
directly; and it was largely used for provisioning
armies.</p>

<div class="caption">A PILGRIMAGE SCENE</div>
</div>

<p>The second class of mediæval traveller, the pilgrim,
is often in evidence about 1600, usually indirect
evidence; the pilgrim who is nothing but
pilgrim leaves practically no detailed record of
himself except when he goes to Jerusalem. Yet
Evelyn was told at Rome that during the year of
Jubilee, 1600, twenty-five thousand five hundred
women visitors were registered at the pilgrims'
hospice of the Holy Trinity there, and four hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and forty thousand men. Also, one who was
at Montserrat in 1599, was told that six hundred
pilgrims dined there every day, and at high festivals
between three thousand and four thousand;
while another (1619) learnt that whereas the
monks' income from their thirty-seven estates
stood at nine thousand scudi (say, thirteen thousand
pounds at to-day's values) annually, they
spent seven times that amount, the balance being
derived from the sale of sanctified articles or from
gifts.<a name="Anchor-3" id="Anchor-3"></a><a href="#Footnote-3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a> On the whole, however, a decrease must be
presupposed during this period on account of the
cessation of pilgrimage among the Protestant half
of Europe. Moreover, the kind of journeying
which is specially characteristic of this period
incidentally tended to further Protestant ideas
and discredit pilgrimage. For pilgrimage was, of
course, towards some relic. Now relics which
mutually excluded each other's genuineness, such
as two heads of one saint, were not likely to be
met with on the same pilgrim route: the establishment
of one such on a given route would
hinder the establishment of a second for financial,
as well as devotional, reasons. But when a believer
travelled for diplomatic or educational
purposes, his direction was quite as likely to lead
across pilgrim routes, as along them. In which
case he would be morally certain to come across
these mutually exclusive relics, on one and the
same journey, and the doubts thus started
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>might be cumulative in their results.<a name="Anchor-4" id="Anchor-4"></a><a href="#Footnote-4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">[4]</a> On the
other hand the very fact of opposition stimulated
pilgrim zeal among the orthodox, as, <i>e. g.</i>, to the
still flourishing shrine of Notre Dame des Ardilliers
near Saumur, as a result of Saumur itself becoming
a headquarters of the "Reformed" creed.
There abided of course the permanent features of
life which make pilgrimage as deep-rooted as the
love of children, and one of the epidemics of pilgrimage
that occur periodically burst out in
France about 1585, so Busbecq writes. Whole
villages of people clothed themselves in white
linen, took crosses and went off to some shrine
two or three days' journey away. The special
cause of this epidemic may perhaps be sought in
the pilgrimage to Our Lady of Chartres by their
queen, in 1582, to beg for relief from her barrenness.
One incident of this journey ought not to
be left buried in the Calendar of Foreign State
Papers, the only place where it has hitherto been
printed. On being told why the queen was going
thither, a countrywoman said, "Alas! Madame
is too late; the good priest who used to make the
children has just died."</p>

<p>An example of the pilgrim we have already met
in Della Valle. Bartholomew Sastrow in his autobiography
reveals a man travelling in search of
work, a very unpleasant man, perhaps, but so
strikingly true a picture of the every-day life and
every-day thought of a lower middle-class man of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>the sixteenth century as not to be surpassed for
any other century, past, present, or future, not
even among autobiographies.</p>

<p>But for the man who is trying to avoid work,
the third of the mediæval types, the vagabond,
it would be out of place to select an individual to
stand for the class in Renascence days, seeing that
it became a stock literary type; vagabondage in
general being epitomized for the time in the Spanish
picaro. The picaro was one who saw much of
the seamy side of life and remembered it with
pleasure—it was all life and the true picaro was
in love with life. The only enemy he had permanently
was civilisation; yet he and it became reconciled
in his old age: a picaro who grew old ceased
to be a picaro. Meanwhile he was always forgiving
civilisation, and being forgiven; both had
equal need of forgiveness. Yet there is one picaro
characteristic hard to overlook—his passion for
being dull at great length when he drops into
print: Lazarillo de Tormes and Gil Bias being the
only ones of whom it may be said that from a
reader's standpoint they were all that they should
have been and nothing that they should not. The
rest, when met between the covers of a book, resemble
the parson whom one of themselves,
Quevedo's Pablos, caught up on the way to Madrid
and whom he hardly prevented from reciting
his verses on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ursula and her eleven thousand
virgins, fifty octavetts to each virgin; even then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>he could not escape a comedy containing more
scenes than there were days in a Jerusalem pilgrimage,
besides five quires concerning Noah's
Ark. This same Pablos explains incidentally
what his kind talked about to chance companions
on the road, for meeting another making for Segovia
they fell into "<span xml:lang="es" lang="es">la conversacion propia de
picaros</span>." Whether the Turk was on the downhill
and how strong was the king: how the Holy Land
might be reconquered, and likewise Algiers: party
politics were then discussed and afterwards the
management of the rebellious Low Countries.
There were, too, picaros of high degree, but these
were all men of war, whereas nothing but hunger
made an ordinary picaro fight. High and low,
however, had this in common, that they preferred
living at others' expense to working, and consequently
shifted their lodgings as often as any
other class of tourist, in deference to local opinion.</p>

<p>Of the fourth mediæval type, the knight-errant,
it is hard to say whether it was extinct or
not: all depends on the extent to which the knight-errant
is idealised. It is certainly true in this degree,
that contemporary fiction must be reckoned
as a cause of travel. Don Quixote is not to be
ignored as a traveller and he was not alone. The
first Earl of Cork's eldest son was so affected by
the romances that the "roving wildness of his
thoughts" which they brought about was only partially
cured by continual extraction of square and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>cube roots. But perhaps the knight-errant of this
date is better identified with the picaro of high degree,
and as such the class may be exemplified by
Don Alonzo de Guzman, the first chapter of whose
autobiography gives a better insight into the
psychology, and life on the road, of the picaro
than the whole flood of nineteenth-century comment
on the subject. At the age of eighteen he
found himself with no father, no money, and a
mother pious but talkative; after having provided
for his needs for a while by marriage, he left home
with a horse, a mule, a bed, and sixty ducats. And
though what follows belongs more to the history
of lying than the history of the world, it throws
side-lights. And at any rate, any excuse is good
enough to turn to it, for Don Alonzo has much in
common with Benvenuto Cellini.</p>

<div class="caption">THE CHEAPEST WAY</div>
</div>

<p>Now we have passed beyond the mediæval
types and come to such as are somewhat more
prominent in this, than in the previous, centuries.
Exiles, for instance. The economic changes that
took place during the sixteenth century made it
increasingly difficult for the equivalents for Chancellors
of the Exchequer to meet the yearly deficits.
The legal authorities were therefore called
upon to assist, and a working arrangement was
established in practically all European countries
whereby the political ferment of the time was
taken advantage of for the betterment of the
finances. Instead of the slow process and meagre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>results of waiting for death-duties, a man of
wealth suffered premature civil death, or was harried
into civil suicide. He was exiled, or fled: he
had become a tourist.</p>

<p>Inseparable from political is religious self-exile.
What happened very often in England was this.
A youngster is seized with that belief in the likelihood
of an ideal life elsewhere and that desire for
a change, which are characteristic of the age of
twenty. The theological cast of the age gives the
former a religious bias. He escapes. After a time
it seems to him that human characteristics have
the upper hand of the apostolic, even in Roman
Catholics, to a greater extent than he once believed,
and that he would like to go home. He
lands, is questioned by the Mayor, reported on to
the Privy Council, in which report his experiences
are to be found summarised.</p>

<p>One class of men, however, which might be expected
to provide many examples, is for the most
part absent,—missionaries,—occupied at home
converting each other at this date, or re-converting
themselves. The chief, in fact, the Jesuits,
were confined each one to his nation by order, and
only in respect of their early training days do they
appear as foreigners abroad. Acknowledgements
are due, on the other hand, for information received,
to captives set free, soldiers, artists, herbalists,
antiquaries, and even to those who, so far
as we know, only looked on, like Shakespeare; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>to many others led abroad by special reasons, such
as the Italian Marquis who felt it necessary for him
to have a long holiday after the privations of Lent.</p>

<p>But with all these varieties of tourist, we still
have not come to the Average Tourist. The type
is extinct, killed by reference-books, telegraphy,
and democracy. For the Average Tourist left his
fatherland to get information which he could not
get at home, and he wanted this information because
he was a junior member of the aristocracy,
at that time the governing class more exclusively
than at present. In feudal days isolation was,
comparatively, taken for granted, and the fact of
that voluntary isolation implied many hindrances
to touring. The need of acquiring information of
every kind that affected political action had been
therefore less realised and the difficulty of acquiring
it greater. These years near 1600 are the
years of transition, transition to a custom for
travellers to</p>

</div>

<p>Herein lies the unity of subject of this book; not
in its concern with a given class of experiences
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>during a given period. Roughly speaking, in the
two half-centuries preceding and succeeding the
year 1600, the practice of the upper classes of
sending sons abroad as part of their education became
successively an experiment, a custom, and,
finally, a system. By the middle of the seventeenth
century this system had become a thoroughly
set system, and the "Grand Tour" a topic
for hack-writers. Of the latter, James Howell was
the first. His "Instructions for Foreign Travel"
(1642) may serve to date the beginning of "Grand
Touring" in the modern sense of the phrase, while
the publication of Andrew Boorde's "Introduction
of Knowledge" a century earlier, does the
same for this preceding period, that of the development
of travel as a means of education.</p>

<p>Delimiting the movement by means of English
books suggests that it was a merely English movement,
but it was in fact European, though true of
the different countries in varying degrees. The
increase of diplomatic journeys,<a name="Anchor-6" id="Anchor-6"></a><a href="#Footnote-6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6.">[6]</a>, already mentioned,
the core of this development and its chief
instrument, was common to all divisions of Europe
in proportion to the degree of the civilisation
attained. In the Empire and Poland the custom
grew up less suddenly; it had begun earlier. In
Italy, it began later, since it was not till later that
there was much for an Italian to learn that he
could not learn better at home. Sir Henry Wotton<a name="Anchor-7" id="Anchor-7"></a><a href="#Footnote-7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">[7]</a>
noted in 1603 that travelling was coming into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>fashion among the young nobles of Venice. In
France, an early beginning was broken off by the
civil wars, not to start afresh till Henry <abbr title="the fourth">IV</abbr>'s
sovereignty was established. As for Spaniards and
Portuguese, they alone had dominions over-sea to
attend to.</p>

<p>In England, on the other hand, political reversals
being at once frequent, thorough, and peaceable,
migrations were very common and usually
short. That touring would result from migration
was certain, because it familiarised English people
with the attractions and the affairs of the continent
and with the uses of that familiarity, and
established communications. Other special causes
existed, too, truisms concerning which are so plentiful
that there is no need to repeat them here.</p>

<p>But the certainty of the change did not prevent
it being slow. Andrew Boorde, who knew Europe
thoroughly, found hardly any of his countrymen
abroad except students and merchants, and for the
following half century it is the tendency rather
than the fact that may be noted, as indicated, for
example, by Sir Philip Sidney, who started in 1572,
writing later to his brother that "a great number
of us never thought in ourselves why we went,
but a certain tickling humour to do as other
men had done." In 1578 Florio could still write in
one of his Italian-English dialogues published in
London:<a name="Anchor-8" id="Anchor-8"></a><a href="#Footnote-8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8.">[8]</a> "'Englishmen, go they through the
world?' 'Yea some, but few.'" Yet in 1592 and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>again in 1595 the Pope complained about the
number of English heretics allowed at Venice,<a name="Anchor-9" id="Anchor-9"></a><a href="#Footnote-9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 9.">[9]</a>
and in 1615 an Englishman, George Sandys, leaves
out of his travel-book everything relating to
places north of Venice, such being, he says, "daily
surveyed and exactly related." Three years earlier
James <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>'s Ambassador at Venice writes<a name="Anchor-10" id="Anchor-10"></a><a href="#Footnote-10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">[10]</a> to the
Doge that there are more than seventy English in
Venice whereas "formerly" there had been four or
five; and when he adds that there are not more
than ten in the rest of Italy it must be remembered
that he is making out a case and even
then refers to Protestants only: between 1579 and
1603, three hundred and fifty Englishmen had
been received into the English College at Rome.<a name="Anchor-11" id="Anchor-11"></a><a href="#Footnote-11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 11.">[11]</a></p>

<p>The development, then, of the English tourist
may be synchronised with the rise of the English
Drama and the expansion of English Commerce.
In other words, the preparation for it came before
the failure of the Spanish Armada; the actuality
directly afterwards. But it could not have followed
the course it did except in conjunction with
wider causes, which emphasise its place as but
part of a European movement. These may be
sought in (1) the slight, but definite, advance in
civilisation which made people more accessible to
the ideas which peace fosters; (2) the greater area
over which peace prevailed round about the year
1600: (3) the increase in centralisation in government,
which decreased the obstacles in the way of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>the traveller, and increased the attractiveness of
particular points, <i>i.e.</i>, where the courts were held.</p>

<p>At the same time the increase in touring which
really took place would be greatly over-estimated
if one considered the evidence of bibliography as
all-sufficient. Almost all that the latter proves is
an increase in writing about it, due to the greatly
increased demand for the written word which was
the outcome of printing. Morelli, in his essay<a name="Anchor-12" id="Anchor-12"></a><a href="#Footnote-12" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 12.">[12]</a> on
little-known Venetian travellers, quotes Giosaffate
Barbaro as writing in 1487, "I have experienced
and seen much that would probably be accounted
rubbish by those who have, so to speak, never
been outside Venice, by reason that such things
are not customary there. And this has been the
chief reason for my never having cared to write of
what I have seen, nor even to speak much thereof."
Yet by 1600 there were probably few countries in
Europe in which recent accounts of the regions
visited by Barbaro could not be read in the vernacular,
accounts out of which some one expected to
see a profit. Indications, on the contrary, of enormous
numbers leaving home may be found in this
one fact; that the names are known of twelve hundred
Germans who passed beyond the limits of
civilised Christendom during the sixteenth century.<a name="Anchor-13" id="Anchor-13"></a><a href="#Footnote-13" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 13.">[13]</a>
What must then be the number of Europeans,
ascertainable and otherwise, who were
going about Europe then?</p>

<p>As regards the Average Tourist, however, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>are not left to our imagination. He is often to be
found in person, young, rich, abroad to learn. Yet—why
should he, rather than his contemporaries
of the lower classes, need teaching? The answer
will come of its own accord if we stop to consider
the similarities and divergences existent between
the Jesuits and the Salvation Army. Both are the
outcome of the same form of human energy, that
of Christianity militant against present-day evils;
it is circumstances that have caused the divergence.
The Jesuits were as keen at first for social
reform as the Salvation Army have become; the
Salvation Army used to be as much preoccupied
with theology as the Jesuits. In details the resemblance
is more picturesque without being any
more accidental. The Salvation Army describe
themselves after the fashion of the Papal title of
"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">servus servorum Dei</span>," as the "servants of all";
and the first thing that Loyola did when his associates
insisted on his adopting the same title that
"General" Booth has assumed, was to go downstairs
and do the cooking. The two societies with
one and the same root-idea essentially, have been
drawn into ministering to the lower class in the
nineteenth century and the upper class three hundred
years earlier: the identity of spirit consisting
in the class that was ministered to being that
which possessed the greatest potentialities and the
greatest needs.<a name="Anchor-14" id="Anchor-14"></a><a href="#Footnote-14" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 14.">[14]</a> And in all the prescribed occupations
of the Average Tourist we shall find this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>implied, that the future of his country depended
on the use he made of his tour.</p>

<p>Let us take two specimens; one in the rough,
the other in the finished, state: No. 1 shall be
John Lauder of Fountainhall; No. 2, the Duc
de Rohan. The former's diary is not to be
equalled for the insight it gives into the development
of the mind of the fledgling-dignitary
abroad; not a pleasant picture always, not the
evolution of a mother's treasure into an omniscient
angel, but of a male Scot of nineteen into the
early stages of a man of this wicked world; but—it
happened. We note his language becoming decidedly
coarser and an introduction to Rabelais'
works not improving matters. Still, the former
would have happened at home, only in a narrower
circle; and for Rabelais, who that has read him
does not know the other side? Then, he did not
always work as a good boy should: he was studying
law at Poictiers, and a German who was there
twenty years earlier tells us that at Poictiers there
were so many students that those who wanted to
work retired to the neighbouring <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jean d'Angely.
Lauder stopped at Poictiers and writes, "I was
beginning to make many acquaintances at Poictiers,
to go in and drink with them, as,"—then follow
several names, then a note by the editor that
twenty-seven lines have been erased in the MS.
It continues: "I was beginning to fall very idle."
Later on: "I took up to drink with me M. de la
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>Porte, de Gruché, de Gey, de Gaule, Baranton's
brother, etc."; [twenty-two lines erased] "on my
wakening in the morning I found my head sore
with the wine I had drunk." Even if one was
wrong-headed enough to agree with what the minister
at Fountainhall would feel obliged to remark
about such occurrences, nothing could counterbalance
the advantage to a Scot of learning
that the Scottish opinion of Scots was not universally
accepted. Lauder is surprised, genuinely humiliated,
to find his countrymen despised abroad
for the iconoclasm that accompanied their "conversion."</p>

<p>Lauder wrote a diary: the Duc de Rohan a "letter"
to his mother, summarising the valuable information
acquired in a virtuous perambulation
through Italy, Hungary, Bohemia, Germany, the
Low Countries, England, including a flying visit
to Scotland; an harangue of flat mediocrity, imitative
in character, thoughtful only in so far as,
and in the way, he had been taught to be thoughtful.
But, read between the lines, it is most interesting;
better representing the Average Tourist in
his nominal every-day state of mind than any
other book. He embodies the sayings and doings
of hundreds of others whose only memorials are on
tombstones or in genealogies; he endures the inns
in silence; never ate nor drank nor saw a coin or a
poor man, for aught he says; passed the country
in haste, ignoring the scenery except where "classical"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
authors had praised it, considered the
Alps a nuisance, and democratic governments a
degraded, albeit successful, eccentricity; and hastened
past the Lago di Garda, in spite of the
new fortress in building there, to Brescia, the latter
being "better worth seeing." It was just 1600
when he travelled, and the ideas of the year are
reflected in his opening lines with an exactitude
possible only to one who has the mind of his contemporaries
and none of his own. "Peace having
been made, I saw I could not be any use in France."
So he employed his idleness in attempting to
learn something, in noting the differences in countries
and peoples. Yet he would not be the Average
Tourist made perfect that he is if there was not
some idea of the future hovering in him—he is
the only traveller, except Sir Henry Blount, the
philosopher, who notes, or even seems to note,
that the chief factor of differences between human
being and human being is geography.</p>

<p>Yet underneath all the special characteristics
which distinguish everyone of these tourists from
every other, there remains one that all share with
each other and with us, that expressed with the
crude controversial Elizabethan vigour in some
lines which Thomas Nashe wrote towards the
close of the sixteenth century—"'Countryman,
tell me what is the occasion of thy straying so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>far ... to visit this strange nation?' ... 'That
which was the Israelites' curse we ... count our
chief blessedness: he is nobody that hath not
travelled'"—the sense of the inexhaustible pleasure
of travel. Had it been otherwise they would
not have cared to write down their experiences; nor
we to read them. And if at times it is hard to find
a reflection of their pleasure in what they have
written, it is certainly there, if only between the
lines, manifesting how this continual variety of
human beings is brought into touch, even if unconsciously,
with the infinite change and range of
the ideas and efforts of millions of persons over
millions upon millions of acres, each person and each
acre with its own history, life, fate, and influence. If,
too, in the course of summarising what they experienced,
the more trivial details seem to occupy
a larger proportion of the space than is their due,
it may be suggested that that is the proportion
in which they appear in the tourists' reminiscences.</p>

<p>The permanent undercurrent I have tried to
suggest where circumstances bring it to the surface
in some one of its more definite forms.</p>

conclusions may be drawn: first, that the
Average Tourist was given much advice;
secondly, that he did not take it. Let us too,
then, see the theory for one chapter only; and,
in all chapters after, the practice.</p>

<p>It must have amused many a youngster to hear
the down-trodden old gentleman, whom his father
had hired, setting forth how the said youngster
must behave in wicked Italy if he was to grow
up in favour with God and man; all the more so
if the old gentleman, whose name, perhaps, was
the local equivalent for John Smith, published his
advice in Latin under a Latin pseudonym, say,
Gruberus or Plotius. Gruberus and Plotius suggest
themselves because they are the very guidiest
of guide-book writers. They, like all the orthodox
of their kind, begin by a solemn argument for
and against travelling. They bring up to support
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>them a most miscellaneous host: the Prophets, the
Apostles, Daedalus, Ulysses, the Queen of Sheba,
Theseus, Anacharsis, the "Church of Christ,"
Pythagoras, Plato, Abraham, Aristotle, Apollonius
of Tyana, Euclid, Zamolxis, Lycurgus,
Naomi, Cicero, Galen, Dioscorides, him who travelled
from farthest Spain to see Livy ("and immediately,"
as some one most unkindly says, "immediately
he saw him, went away"); Solon also
and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul, and Mithridates, the Roman Decemviri,
Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, Pausanias, Cluverius,
Moses, Orpheus, Draco, Minos, Rhadamanthus,
Æsculapius, Hippocrates, Avicenna, the
physicians of Egypt and the gods of Greece. But
there is not a word about Jonah; perhaps his luck
and experiences were considered abnormal; or perhaps
because, as Howell says, "he travelled much,
but saw little."</p>

<p>Then there are those who have to be refuted or
explained away: Socrates, Seneca, the Lacedaemonians,
Athenians, Chinese, Muscovites, Psophidius,
Elianus, and Pompeius Laetus. Cain,
also, the first traveller, creates a prejudice. Likewise,
the argument from experience has to be met.
Some return from travel, they say, using phrases
without meaning, pale, lean, scabby and worm-eaten,
burdens on their consciences, astounding
garments on their backs, with the manners of an
actor and superciliously stupid. Yet is this not
due to the thing itself, but to the abuse thereof;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>peradventure he shall be corrupted more quickly
at home than abroad, and there is less to be feared
from universities and strange lands than from the
indulgent mother. Moreover "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">non nobiliora quam
mobiliora</span>"; the heavens rejoice in motion, and
transplantation yieldeth new life to plants. And
shall the little sparrow travel as he pleases and
man, lord of the animals, be confined to a farm or
a hamlet?</p>

<p>Reason, erudition and emotion having thus
conquered, instruction begins. The forethought
necessary is as great as if he were choosing a wife.
For tutors and horses, it seems, the most that can
be expected from them is that they shall not imperil
his soul and body respectively. First among
requisites is a book of prayers and hymns effective
for salvation without being so pugnacious, doctrinally,
as to cause suspicion. Next, a note-book,
a watch, or a pocket sun-dial; if a watch, not a
striker, for that warns the wicked you have cash;
a broad-brimmed hat, gaiters, boots, breeches (as
if his friends would let him start without any!),
gloves, shoes, shirts, handkerchiefs, "which come
in useful when you perspire"; and if he cannot take
many shirts, let those he takes be washed, he will
find it more comfortable. Also, a linen overall, to
put over his clothes when he gets into bed, in case
the bed is dirty. Let him get to know something
of medicine and, "like Achilles," learn to cook
before he leaves home. Travel not at night, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>in daytime, be guarded by the official guards
which German and Belgian towns provide; or
travel in company.</p>

<p>Now, the aim of travelling is the acquisition of
knowledge; stay, therefore, in the more famous
places rather than keep on the move. Enquire,
concerning the district, its names, past and present;
its language; its situation; measurements;
number of towns, or villages; its climate, fertility;
whether maritime or not, and possessing forests,
mountains, barren or wooded; wild beasts, profitable
mines; animal or vegetable life peculiar to
itself; navigable or fish-yielding rivers; medicinal
baths; efficient fortresses. And concerning towns:
the founder, "sights," free or otherwise; what the
town has undergone, famines, plagues, floods,
fires, sieges, revolutions, sackings; whether it has
been the scene of councils, conferences, synods,
assemblies, gatherings, or tournaments.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that in this last paragraph
I am paraphrasing Gruberus only, and
presume he is confining himself to what the young
tourist should discover before breakfast; otherwise
he is but a superficial instructor compared to
Plotius. The latter draws up a series of questions,
which include enquiries about weights and measures;
about the clergy, how many and what salaries;
religion, is it "reformed"? if so, what has
happened to monks and nuns; how often Communion
is administered; and whether strangers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>are received thereat; arrangements for burial.
This last question would seem more in place at the
end, but it is only number thirty-six, and there
are one hundred and seventeen questions altogether.
Then, is there a University? and, if so,
may the rector whack the students? and concerning
the professors, what they teach and what they
are paid. As for local government, the enquiries
exhaust possibilities. Also, how many houses; and
what about night-watchmen; legal procedure;
"ancient lights," the right to use water, executors'
duties, grounds for divorce, dress, military
training? Furthermore: are the roads clean, and
can children marry without their parents' consent?
concerning methods of cookery, and antiquity of
the town; whether the position of an officer of justice
is a respected one or not; concerning notaries
public; and whether the water used in cooking
comes from river, fountain, well, or rain; how
many varieties of grain are used in bread-making;
and what means have they for dealing with fires;
their sanitary arrangements and public holidays,
with the reasons for the latter; care of paupers,
orphans, and lepers; what punishments for what
crimes.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that Gruberus and
Plotius thought of all this by themselves: they
copied others, being but two among many. Where
the copying reached its most uncritical extreme
was in the origins ascribed to towns: Paris, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>guide-books say, was founded by a Gaul of that
name who lived two hundred years before his
namesake of Troy; Haarlem is also named after
its founder "Herr (<i>i.e.</i>, Mr.) Lem"; Toulouse
dated from the time of the prophetess Deborah;
and so on.</p>

<p>But to consider the foregoing instructions, and
even these three "facts," on their humorous side
only, is to miss much of their interest. Two, for
instance, of these etymologies are but examples of
what is not only continually coming into notice
in books of this date, but is especially noticeable
in guide-books and tourists' notes, in which latter
the habit of mind of the time is more exactly mirrored
in its daily attitude than in any other class
of books. They exemplify the two sources of
knowledge of antiquity, the two standards of comparison,
then available: classical and biblical; of
more nearly equal authority than they were before
or have been since; and they were the only
ones. So with the objects of enquiry: they are implied
by that lack of reference books from which
not only the tourist, but governments also, suffered;
it is clear, for example, that in 1592 much
elementary information was not at hand, even in
manuscript, in England.<a name="Anchor-15" id="Anchor-15"></a><a href="#Footnote-15" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 15.">[15]</a> The Tsar, moreover,
about this time addressed a letter to the "Governor
of the High Signiory of Venice," his advisers
thinking that Venice was governed by a nominee
of the Pope; and Rivadeneyra, who was very well-informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
about affairs English, says in his "<span xml:lang="es" lang="es">Cisma
de Inglaterra</span>," written thirty years after the reform
of the English currency under Elizabeth:
"The gold and silver currency is not so pure nor
so fine as it was before heresy entered into the
kingdom, for in the time of Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII</abbr> and his
children Edward and Elizabeth, it has been falsified
and alloyed with other metals, and so the
money is worth much less than it used to be."
Camden again, who wrote his Annals of Elizabeth's
Reign early in the next century to correct
misconceptions to which foreign scholars were
liable, thought it necessary, when he mentioned
Dublin, to explain that it was the chief city of
Ireland; and very reasonably, too, considering
that one of Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII</abbr>'s officials in Ireland wrote
home: "Because the country called Leinster and
the situation thereof is unknown to the King and
his Council, it is to be understood that Leinster
is the fifth part of Ireland."<a name="Anchor-16" id="Anchor-16"></a><a href="#Footnote-16" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 16.">[16]</a> And there was a
certain gentleman at the court of King James <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>,
supposed to be an authority on things Continental,
who answered, when asked for information about
Venice, that he could not give much because he
had ridden post through it—and it was not till the
questioner got there that he became aware that
Venice was surrounded by water; just as the secretary
of a Spanish duke in England writes that his
master took ship from "Calais, because, England
being an island, it cannot be approached by land."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>
<p>It may perhaps seem that the absence of knowledge
which is ordinary now, indicated by the
above illustrations, was extraordinary rather than
ordinary even then. But the fact was that, besides
the available books being practically always
too much behind the times for any but antiquaries'
purposes, the writers themselves had so
little information at hand that it was only here
and there their writings were anything but hopelessly
superficial, even when obtained; and to
obtain them was no easy matter. There were at
least three men who published practical handbooks
in English for Continental travelling later
than Andrew Boorde and earlier than Howell;
yet they, and Howell also, each claim that theirs
is the first book of its kind in English. Whether
the statement is made in good faith, or for business
purposes, it proves equally well that even
if a book was written, it was not easy to find.</p>

<p>Or again, take a book which was so often republished
as to be easy to obtain, the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Viaggio da
Venetia al Santo Sepolcro</span>," for instance, the authorship
of the later editions of which is ascribed
to one Father Noë, a Franciscan. The first edition
seems to be that of 1500, and it continued to
be reprinted down to 1781; at least thirty-four editions
came out before 1640, when the period under
consideration ends. It was not, however, an Italian
book originally, having been translated from
a German source which was in existence as early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>as 1465, if not earlier.<a name="Anchor-17" id="Anchor-17"></a><a href="#Footnote-17" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 17.">[17]</a> Since, therefore, its information
was never thoroughly revised, at any
rate, not before 1640, sixteenth-century and seventeenth-century
pilgrims went on buying mid-fifteenth-century
information. They were recommended,
for instance, to go by the pilgrim galley,
which ceased to run about 1586; and also to take
part in a festival held yearly on the banks of the
Jordan at Epiphany, which must have been abandoned
far earlier even than that.</p>

<p>Still, books about what there was to notice in
given places did exist just as there were treatises
of the Gruberus and Plotius kind unfolding what
should be noticed in general, and why. Best
known of the earlier kind was Münster's gigantic
"Cosmography," which Montaigne regretted he
had not brought with him; and by the middle of
the seventeenth century several other first-rate
geographers, besides minor men, had compiled
books of the kind. But the bearing of such books
on our subject is only in so far as they reflect the
thoughts, and ministered to the needs, of the
tourist; and they may therefore be best considered
in the works of those who wrote "Itineraries,"
which not only recorded journeys but were
meant to serve as examples of how a journey
might be made the most of. Such a book was
Hentzner's, a sort of link between Gruberus and
Fynes Moryson. Hentzner was a Silesian who
acted as guide and tutor to a young nobleman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>from 1596 to 1600. They began, and ended, their
journey at Breslau, and toured through Germany,
France, Switzerland, Italy, and England; the
"Itineraria" being based on notes made by the
way. His account of England does him rather
more than justice, for there is some first-hand
experience there, which is just what is lacking
in the rest of his book. Practically everything
he says is second-hand, and the fact of his being
at a place is merely a peg to hang quotations on.
When he is not quoting from books he seems to
be quoting from people; and half of what we
expect from a guide-book is absent: means of
conveyance, for instance. This is an omission,
however, which can be explained: he was only
concerned with the most respectable form of
travelling, and that meant, on horseback. And
the rest of his omissions, taken all together, throw
into relief the academic character of the book,
due, not to himself individually so much as to
the period. His preface cannot, naturally, differ
much from Plotius, nor add much, except in
recommending Psalms 91, 126, 127, and 139 as
suitable for use by those about to travel, forgetting,
it would seem, the one beginning, "When
Israel went forth out of Egypt," which Pantagruel
had sung by his crew before they set out to
find the "Holy Bottle"; and being a Protestant
he cannot recommend the invocation of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Joseph and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony of Padua, the patron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>saints of travellers; all he can do is to pray at the
beginning for good angels to guard his footsteps,
and, at the end, to acknowledge assistance from
one, although it does not appear that he ever
went to the length of Uhland's traveller:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
     <div class="verse">Take, O boatman, thrice thy fee,—</div>
     <div class="verse">Take, I give it willingly;</div>
     <div class="verse">For, invisible to thee,</div>
     <div class="verse">Spirits twain have crossed with me,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>and paid a fare for the good angel. On the way,
having reached, say Rome, he does not, in
Baedeker's merciful fashion, tell you the hotels
first, in order of merit, but begins straightway:
"<span class="smcap">Rome.</span> Mistress and Queen of Cities, in times
past the head of well-nigh all the world, which she
had subjected to her rule by virtue of the sublime
deeds of the most stout-hearted of men. Concerning
the first founders thereof there are as many
opinions, and as different, as there are writers.
Some there are who think that Evander, in his
flight from Arcadia," etc. Yet no one could write
over six hundred pages about a four years' tour
in sixteenth-century Europe without being valuable
at times; partly in relation to ideas, partly
to experiences into which those ideas led him and
his pupils.</p>

<p>It was less than twenty years after Hentzner
that another German published a record of travel
which was also meant as a guide. But time had
worked wonders; it was not only a personal difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
between the former and Zinzerling that
accounts for the difference in their books; it was
the increase in the number of tourists. The latter
sketches out a plan by means of which all France
can be seen at the most convenient times and most
thoroughly without waste of time, with excursions
to England, the Low Countries, and Spain.
Routes are his first consideration; other hints
abound. At <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas is a host who is a terror
to strangers; and remember that at Saint-Savin,
thirty leagues from Bourges, is the shanty of
"Philemon and Baucis" where you can live for
next to nothing; and that outside the gate at
Poictiers is a chemist who speaks German, and so
on. Frequently, indeed, he notes where you may
find your German understood; and also where
you should learn, and where avoid learning,
French.</p>

<p>Advice of this last-mentioned kind calls to
mind a third class of guide-books, intended to
assist those who, without them, would realise
how vain is the help of man when he can't understand
what you say. The need for such became
more and more evident as time went on and
Latin became less and less the living and international
language it had been but recently. The
use of vernaculars was everywhere coming to the
front as nationalities developed further, and in
many districts where it had been best known its
disuse in Church hastened its disuse outside.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<p>The extent to which Latin was current about
1600 varied in almost every country. Poland and
Ireland came first, Germany second, where many
of all classes spoke it fluently, and less corruptly
than in Poland. Yet an Englishman<a name="Anchor-18" id="Anchor-18"></a><a href="#Footnote-18" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 18.">[18]</a> passing
through Germany in 1655 found but one innkeeper
who could speak it. The date suggests
that the Thirty Years' War was responsible for
the change. It is certainly true that France in
the previous half century was far behind Germany
in the matter of speaking Latin, as a result
of the civil wars there. Possibly the characters
of its rulers had something to do with this too,
just as in England, where Latin was ordinarily
spoken by the upper classes, according to Moryson,
with ease and correctness, the accomplishments
of Queen Elizabeth as a linguist had doubtless
set a fashion. This much, at least, is certain:
that in 1597 when an ambassador from Poland
was unexpectedly insolent in his oration, the
Queen dumbfounded him by replying on the spot
with as excellent Latinity as spirit, whereas at
Paris once, when a Latin oration was expected
from another ambassador, not only could not the
King reply, but not even any one at court. With
Montaigne the case was certainly different, but
then his father had had him taught Latin before
French, and consequently, on his travels, so soon
as he reached a stopping-place, he introduced
himself to the local priest, and though neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>knew the other's native language, they passed
their evening conversing without difficulty.</p>

<p>Very many were the interesting interviews that
many a tourist had which he owed to a knowledge
of Latin; the extent to which knowledge was acquired
orally having led to its being an ordinary
incident in the life of the tourist to pay a call on
the learned man of the district; a duty with the
Average Tourist, a pleasure for the others. And
Latin was the invariable medium, part of the
respectability of the occasion. At least, not quite
invariable: when the historian De Thou visited
the great Sigonius, they talked Italian, because
the latter, in spite of a lifetime spent in becoming
the chief authority on Roman Italy, spoke Latin
with difficulty.</p>

<p>It seems curious that Latin should have been
less generally understood south, than north, of
the Alps, but such was the fact. Italy was, however,
ahead of Spain, where even an acquaintance
with Latin was rare. In the first quarter of the
sixteenth century Navagero found Alcalá the
only university where lectures were delivered in
Latin, and, according to the best of the guide-book
writers on Spain, Zeiler, the doctorate at
Salamanca could be obtained, early in the seventeenth
century, without any knowledge of Latin
at all; while it has been shown by M. Cirot, the
biographer of Mariana, that the latter's great
history of Spain, published in Latin at this time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>and as successful as a book of the kind ever is in
its own day, was unsaleable until translated into
Spanish.</p>

<p>Among those, too, who did know Latin there
was the barrier of differing pronunciation. Lauder
of Fountainhall was very much at sea to begin
with, in spite of his Scotch pronunciation being
much nearer to the French than an Englishman's
would have been, and there is an anecdote in
Vicente Espinel's "Marcos de Obregon" which
is to the point here. The latter is a novel, it is
true, but the tradition that it is semi-autobiographical
is borne out by many of its tales reading
as if they were actual experiences, of which the
following is one. One day, the hero, a Spaniard,
found himself in a boat on the river Po, with a
German, an Italian, and a Frenchman, and to
pass the time they tried to talk Latin so that all
could understand each one; but they soon abandoned
the plan, as the pronunciations varied too
greatly.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the passing of Latin out of European
conversation is to be attributed rather
to the growth of Italian, and later of French, as
international tongues. Gaspar Ens, who wrote a
series of guides to nearly every part of Europe,
says in his preface to the volume on France, "At
this day their language is so much used in almost
every part of the world that whosoever is unskilled
therein is deemed a yokel." This was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>1609, at which date, or soon after, it was as true
as a general statement can be expected to be;
just as much so as the assertion in the preface
to an English book in 1578: "Once every one knew
Latin ... now the Italian is as widely spread."<a name="Anchor-19" id="Anchor-19"></a><a href="#Footnote-19" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 19.">[19]</a></p>

<p>It was only in the north that French came to
rival Italian during this period, for the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lingua
franca</span>," also known as "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">franco piccolo</span>," the
hybrid tongue in which commerce was conducted
along the shores of the Mediterranean, was so
largely Italian that to the average Britisher, from
whom Hakluyt drew his narratives, the two were
indistinguishable; but an Italian would notice, as
Della Valle did, that no form of a verb but the
infinitive was used. If any one was met who knew
more than two languages, he would oftenest be
a Jew, who usually knew Spanish and Portuguese;
the latter because the tribe of Judah, from which
their deliverer was to come, was supposed to be
domiciled in Portugal.</p>

<p>Another hybrid language, as well established
in its own area as the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lingua franca</span>," was Scot-French,
so constantly in use as to have an existence
as a literary dialect as well as in French
burlesque. These mixed languages have no place
in the ordinary book-guide to languages, but
were left to personal tuition; yet in the lists of
the most common phrases which Andrew Boorde
appends to each of his descriptions of countries
may be noted a curious instance from this borderland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>of philology. In both the Italian and the
Spanish lists he renders "How do you fare?"
by "Quo modo stat cum vostro corps?"</p>

<p>While we are on this subject we may stop to
sympathise with awkward misunderstandings like
that of the Jesuit Possevino at Moscow, when
invited to (Orthodox) Mass ("obednia") with
intent to compromise him; he went, thinking it
was dinner ("obed") to which he had been asked.
Then there are those, too, whose efforts were
hopelessly below even this standard, such as
Alonzo de Guzman, who suffered hunger in Germany
because he only knew Spanish, and was
put on the road to Bologna when he wanted to get
to Cologne; or the Englishman who was trying
to find that same road and went along staggering
the peasantry with the question, "Her ist das der
raight stroze auf balnea?" the peasantry replying
by signs that he interpreted as directions, but
the road led him further than ever from Baden.
To which class belonged a certain friend of Josias
Bodley, younger brother of the founder of the
Bodleian library and author of by far the liveliest
account of a tour at this period,<a name="Anchor-20" id="Anchor-20"></a><a href="#Footnote-20" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 20.">[20]</a> will never be
known, but that is no reason why the tale should
not be re-told. "Not long ago I was in company
with some boon companions who were drinking
healths in usquebagh, when one was present who
wished to appear more abstemious than the rest
and would not drink with them, to whom one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>of them, who could not speak Latin as well as
I do, said these words, '<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Si tu es plus sapientis
quam nos sumus, tu es plus beholden to God
Almighty quam nos sumus.</span>'" And finally there
are those who find themselves reduced to sign-language,
such as the Roman Catholics who
found a sumptuous dinner awaiting them at a
Protestant inn on a fast-day, when, to add to the
trial of refusing it, was the apparent impossibility
of making their wants understood, until one of
their number, a priest, by the way, imitated a
hen's cackle and "laid" a piece of white paper
the shape and size of an egg!</p>

<p>While conversation-dictionaries existed which
claimed to be useful their claim has no other
basis than that of their own prefaces; the tourists
do not own to indebtedness to them. But taking
it for granted that primary needs must be served
by persons, not books, for further acquirements
Moryson recommends the romance of "Amadis
de Gaule" which was being read by every one in
his own tongue. Probably the conversation-books
are of more use now than at the time of
their publication, from the light they occasionally
throw on customs, and, through their phoneticism,
on pronunciation. Yet the tourists' own
evidence as to this is more valuable, as being
more authentic, when an Englishman writes
"Landtaye" for "Landtage" and "Bawre" for
"Bauer." As for sixteenth-century maps, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>seem meant for gifts rather to an enemy than to
a friend. In every department, then, the tourist
had recourse to persons.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 572px;"><a id="i_b_052fp"></a>

<div class="caption">A TYPICAL TOWN-PLAN</div>
</div>

<p>The qualifications for a first-rate guide, then
and now, differ in one respect only,—that a
"religious test" should be applied was taken for
granted on both sides. In fact, in Scotland in
1609 an edict was issued forbidding young noblemen
to leave the country without a Protestant
tutor: the reason being that the great danger of
a tour abroad lay in a possible change in the
youngster's religion, or inclinations towards tolerance
developing, with the result that his political
career on his return might be dangerous to his
country and himself through his being more than
the just one step ahead of his fellow-countrymen
which is necessary to political salvation.</p>

<p>The prevailing state of mind may be illustrated
by one or two anecdotes. The following one
Lauder tells of himself is characteristic of his
kind. He had entered a church where all were
on their knees: "a woman observing that I neither
had gone to the font for holy water, neither
kneeled, in a great heat of zeal she told me '<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ne
venez icy pour prophaner ce sainct lieu.</span>' I suddenly
replied: '<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vous estez bien devotieuse, madame,
mais peut estre vostre ignorance prophane
ce sainct lieu d'avantage que ma présence.</span>'"
William Lithgow is proud to say he quarrelled
with companions simply because they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>Papists, and had often seized opportunities to
tear in pieces the rich garments on images rather
than "with indifferent forbearance wink at the
wickedness of idolaters." And an Englishman
of good education and breeding and character,
says that being at Malaga cathedral during High
Mass "so long as we were bare-headed and behaved
ourselves civilly and gravely, we might
walk up and down and see everything without
the least molestation." One extreme was naturally
accompanied by another extreme. Sometimes
the tourist's return never took place. This
was the more likely when the Papacy was in a
militant mood, at which times the Inquisition developed
a taste for tutors; whose arrest served
a double purpose, a hot antagonist was secured,
unimportant enough to create no serious trouble,
and the young nobleman was left undefended
on his sectarian side, probably a vulnerable one.
One case of many is that of John Mole,<a name="Anchor-21" id="Anchor-21"></a><a href="#Footnote-21" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 21.">[21]</a> who died
in the prison of the Inquisition at Rome in 1638
at the age of eighty, after thirty years' imprisonment;
his ward, Lord Roos, having been credited
with no particular desire to get him out.</p>

<p>A visit to Rome, however, and to other places,
such as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer, where "seminaries" existed for
English Roman Catholics, was usually forbidden
in the licence to go abroad which every Englishman
had to obtain unless he was a merchant, and
which was not granted without good reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>shown. This contained ordinarily a time limit
also, one year's leave, or three; and prohibition
of communication with disloyal countrymen or
entry into a State at war with England: supervision
of a kind which was exercised by practically
every European ruler. A Roman Catholic,
for instance, incurred excommunication if he
passed into a country at war with the Pope.</p>

<div class="caption">A TYPICAL MAP</div>
</div>

<p>The precautions of Protestant sovereigns were
against Roman Catholicism inasmuch as there
lay political dangers, but so far as religion was
concerned, as much precaution might reasonably
have been taken against Mohammedanism. In
no European country did ability bring a man to
the top so readily as in Turkey, and being a foreigner
was in a man's favour; not even at Venice
was there such a mixture of nations as at Constantinople;
the majority of the Grand Signor's
eminent subjects were renegade foreigners. Dallam
might refuse the invitation; many accepted
it; and a Turk considered it only humane to give an
unbeliever at least one definite invitation to salvation.
An occasion which many would make
use of to turn Turk was during the fortnight preceding
the circumcision of the Sultan's heir. One
traveller saw two hundred circumcised at such a
time, many of them adult, one said to be as old as
fifty-three. As a particular instance of an English
"Turk" there is the case of the English Consul
at Cairo in 1601. He was "taking care" of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>much belonging to English merchants at the time,
in the possession of which the Turks no doubt
confirmed him. At the same time there was an
exactly similar case of a Venetian, for the same purpose.
But besides the causes of the chance to
rise in the world, or the attractions of others' property,
there was another reason for apostacy, the
chief one—mitigating the sufferings of captivity.</p>

<p>But the renegades came mostly from the lower
or the commercial class, and did not come home,
so that the fact that a guide was required to be a
sectarian, in contradistinction to a Christian, is
another comment on the characteristics of the
Average Tourist. Sir Walter Ralegh, however,
did not make that a qualification, for he chose
Ben Jonson to chaperon his son. There is only
one anecdote about Ben Jonson in that capacity,
the one he told Drummond himself. "This
youth" [<i>i.e.</i>, Ralegh's son] "being knavishly
inclined, caused him to be drunken, and dead
drunk, so that he knew not where he was; thereafter
laid him on a car, which he made to be
drawn through the streets, at every corner showing
his governor stretched out and telling them
that was a more lively image of the Crucifix than
any they had: at which young Ralegh's mother
delighted much (saying his father when young
was so inclined), though the father abhorred it."</p>

<p>Another sixteenth-century guide immortalised
by another's pen is Jean Bouchet, "Traverseur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>de Voies Perilleuses" as he called himself. Not
that Rabelais, to whom the pen belonged, names
him, only he applies this nickname to the guide
of Pantagruel and company, Xenomanes (<i>i. e.</i>,
"mad on foreigners"). No easy task to be an
orthodox guide with Friar John at one's elbow;
for guide-book etymologies Friar John had no
taste; only asked, "What's that to do with me?
I wasn't in the country when it was baptised!"
A guide to suit Friar John would have been some
disciple of Montaigne, who while agreeing with
the others that travelling was one of the best
forms of education thought that it was not "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pour
en rapporter seulement, à la mode de nostre
noblesse françoise, combien de pas a 'Santa
Rotonda,' ou la richesse des calessons de la signora
Livia; ou, comme d'aultres, combien le
visage de Neron, de quelque vieille ruyne de là,
est plus long ou plus large que celuy de quelque
pareille medaille, mais pour rapporter principalement
les humeurs de ces nations et leur façons,
et pour frotter et limer nostre cervelle contre celle
d'aultruy.</span>"</p>

<p>Others, too, like Montaigne, without setting
out to write guide-books, have guidance to offer
as a result of experience of life and travel; sometimes
in letters, sometimes in chance remarks.
Letters of this kind which have survived are
many, but so much alike are they as to suggest
that the fathers shrunk from explaining to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>sons how they themselves had made the most of
their time and fell back on unacknowledged quotations
from a Gruberus. Of the few frank ones
the two best are by Sir Philip Sidney to his
brother, and by the ninth Earl of Northumberland
to his son Algernon.<a name="Anchor-22" id="Anchor-22"></a><a href="#Footnote-22" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 22.">[22]</a> Although the latter
is nearly as encyclopædic as Plotius, it is so
merely in the way of suggestion, discussing only
motives and ideas and insisting on his son's freedom
of choice, in general as well as in detail; with
one or two remarks added that would have scandalised
the guide-book writer, but leaven the
whole of the letter. It is especially interesting
as showing how the idea of travel as a factor in
life brought out the best of a man who was a
failure at home from a day-by-day point of view.</p>

<p>As for chance remarks: one likens travelling
to death in so far as it means separation from
friends, letters, moreover, yielding as little satisfaction
as prayers; and whereas the wise say that
death is the entrance to a happier life, there is
the opposite prospect with travel, so that it has
all the disadvantages of hell as well as of death.
And here may follow a few more remarks of
theirs, chosen as suggestive of the characteristics
of sixteenth-century travel in so far as it differs
from our own, not neglecting proverbs:—</p>

<p>A traveller has need of a falcon's eye, an ass's
ears, a monkey's face, a merchant's words, a
camel's back, a hog's mouth, a deer's feet. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>the traveller to Rome—the back of an ass, the
belly of a hog, and a conscience as broad as the
king's highway.</p>

<p>Line your doublet with taffetie; taffetie is lice-proof.</p>

<p>Never journey without something to eat in
your pocket, if only to throw to dogs when attacked
by them.</p>

<p>Carry a note-book and red crayon (<i>i. e.</i>, lead
pencils were not in regular use).</p>

<p>When going by coach, avoid women, especially
old women; they always want the best places.</p>

<p>At sea, remove your spurs; sailors make a point
of stealing them from those who are being sea-sick.
Keep your distance from them in any case;
they are covered with vermin.</p>

<p>In an inn-bedroom which contains big pictures,
look behind the latter to see they do not conceal
a secret door, or a window.</p>

<p>Women should not travel at all and married
men not much.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="3">III</abbr><br />

<small>ON THE WATER</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p xml:lang="it" lang="it">Chi può venire per mare non è lontano.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Paolo Sarpi</span>, 1608.<a name="Anchor-23" id="Anchor-23"></a><a href="#Footnote-23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a><br />
</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Hentzner,</span> in his preface, acknowledges
that the troubles of a traveller are great
and finds only two arguments to countervail
them: that man is born unto trouble, and
that Abraham had orders to travel direct from
God. Abraham, however, did not have to cross
the Channel. Otherwise, perhaps, the prospect
of sacrificing himself as well as his only son Isaac,
would have brought to light a flaw in his obedience.
There was, it is true, the chance of crossing
from Dover to Calais in four hours, but the
experiences of Princess Cecilia, already related,
were no less likely. In 1610 two Ambassadors
waited at Calais fourteen days before they could
make a start, and making a start by no means
implied arriving—at least, not at Dover; one
gentleman, after a most unhappy night, found
himself at Nieuport next morning and had to
wait three days before another try could be made.
Yet another, who had already sailed from Boulogne
after having waited six hours for the tide,
accomplished two leagues, been becalmed for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>nine or ten hours, returned to Boulogne by rowing-boat,
and posted to Calais, found no wind to take
him across there and had to charter another
rowing-boat at sunset on Friday, reaching Dover
on Monday between four and five <span class="smcap lowercase">A. M.</span> It was
naturally a rare occurrence to go the whole distance
by small boat, because of the risk. Lord
Herbert of Cherbury was the most noteworthy
exception; after he had made three attempts from
Brill and covered distances which varied from
just outside the harbour to half-way, arriving
at Brill again, however, each time, he went by
land to Calais, where the sea was so dangerous
that no one would venture, no one except one
old fisherman, whose boat, he himself owned,
was one of the worst in the harbour, but, on the
other hand, he did not mind whether he lived
or died.</p>

<p>But finishing the crossing by rowing-boat was
a very ordinary experience because of the state
of the harbours. Calais was the better of the two,
yet it sometimes happened that passengers had
to be carried ashore one hundred yards or more
because not even boats could approach. In 1576
an ambassador to France complains that Dover
harbour is in such utter ruin that he will cross
elsewhere in future; in 1580 Sir Walter Ralegh
procured reform, which was perpetually in need
of renewal. In time a stone pier was built, small,
and dry at low water, as indeed the whole harbour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>was; the entrance was narrow and kept from being
choked up only by means of a gate which let out
the water with a rush at low tide. The ancient,
quicker route to Wissant, more or less the route
which "Channel-swimmers" make for now, had
begun to be abandoned when the English obtained
a port of their own on the opposite coast,
and had been completely dropped by this time.
Boulogne had no cross-channel passenger traffic
worth mentioning. Dieppe, on the contrary, was
as much used as Calais, the corresponding harbour
being, not Newhaven, but Rye, which was
also the objective on the rarer occasions when the
starting-place was Havre. So unusual was the
Havre-Southampton passage that among the suspicious
circumstances alleged against a Genoese
who landed in 1599, one was his choice of this way
across.<a name="Anchor-24" id="Anchor-24"></a><a href="#Footnote-24" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 24.">[24]</a></p>

<p>Going by the North Sea the usual havens were
Gravesend, and Flushing or Brill, in spite of
Brill's shallow harbour-bar, passed on one occasion
with only two feet of water under the keel
when "Mr. Thatcher, a merchant of London,
who had goods therein, was so apprehensive that
he changed colours and said he was undone, 'Oh
Lord,' and such-like passionate expressions." Harwich
was reputed so dangerous a harbour that
when Charles <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>'s mother-in-law came to visit
her daughter in 1638 and put in there, she
found no one to receive her; it not being thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>within possibility to expect her to land there.
The fact that she did was probably due to her
having been seven days at sea in a storm; not
that the courtier-chronicler of her voyage allows
she was any the worse for it, although he owns of
her ladies that "they touched the hearts of the
beholders more with pity than with love." A
forty-eight-hour passage was nothing to grumble
at: Arthur Wilson, the historian of James <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>'s
reign, left Brill in an old twenty-five-ton mussel-boat,
at the bottom of which he lay, sea-sick and
expecting drowning, for three days and three
nights until he came ashore at—the Hague.</p>

<p>Among many other experiences of the kind,
that<a name="Anchor-25" id="Anchor-25"></a><a href="#Footnote-25" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 25.">[25]</a> of John Chamberlain, the letter-writer,
may be chosen. Setting out from Rotterdam,
after twenty-four hours' sailing, he had been
within sight of Ostend and was back again at
Rotterdam. There he stayed a fortnight, putting
to sea at intervals and coming back. Then the
wind came fair for Calais, but veered round rather
too soon and the first haven they could reach was
that of Yarmouth, after two days' running before
the storm. It was low tide; they went aground
while entering, and for some time it looked like
being lost with all hands, but getting off again,
the waves took the ship against the piles at the
head of the breakwater. Some thought it worth
while trying to jump ashore, three of whom the
others saw drowned and one crushed to death
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>against the piles. But in the end the rest landed
safely in boats, and buried the dead; and Chamberlain
himself, after a winter evening spent wandering
about Newmarket heath in the rain and wind
through the guide losing his way, arrived in town
at 11 <span class="smcap lowercase">P. M.</span> on the twentieth day after first leaving
Rotterdam.</p>

<p>On this route the ownership of the vessel might
be guessed by the amount of swearing that went
on. Dutch ships had no prayers said, rarely
carried a chaplain even on the longest voyages,
but swearers were fined, even if it was no more
than naming the devil. Psalm-singing would go
on on any vessel manned by Protestants on
account of the popularity of the music written
for the Reformers, but if a vessel had a garland
of flowers hanging from its mainmast that again
would show it a Dutchman; it meant that the
captain was engaged to be married.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 532px;"><a id="i_b_064fp"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_064fp.jpg" width="532" height="400" alt="A CHANNEL PASSAGE-BOAT" />
<div class="caption">A CHANNEL PASSAGE-BOAT</div>
</div>

<p>The passage-boats were about sixty feet long,
which then meant a tonnage of about the same
figure, and had a single deck, beneath which the
passengers might find shelter if the merchandise
left them room. The complement of passengers
may be taken as seventy. The highest total of
passengers I have found mentioned for one ship
is two thousand, of whom Della Valle was one,
but that was when he sailed from Constantinople
to Cairo, the vessels employed on official business
between those two places exclusively being the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>largest in the world at that date. Apart from
these, the maximum tonnage was about twelve
hundred, and a 500-ton ship was reckoned a large
one; an average Venetian merchantman measured
about 90 feet × 20 × 16, a tonnage, that is, of about
166, according to English sixteenth-century reckoning.<a name="Anchor-26" id="Anchor-26"></a><a href="#Footnote-26" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 26.">[26]</a>
The French traveller Villamont says the
ship in which he left Venice in 1589 and which
he was told cost fifty thousand crowns (say
eighty-five thousand pounds of our money) to
build and equip, had for its greatest length 188
feet and greatest breadth 59 feet.</p>

<p>As for accommodation in the larger boats, neither
Dallam nor Moryson changed their clothes or
slept in a bed while at sea, and there is no reason
to suppose that any one else did who travelled
under ordinary conditions. Cabins were to be
had in the high-built sterns; even in Villamont's
moderate-sized ship there were eight decks astern,
the fourth from the keel, the captain's dining-room,
accommodating thirty-nine persons at
meal-times, all of whom, it is clear enough, slept
in cabins above or below. Moryson, however,
refused a cabin, preferring to sleep in a place
where there was cover overhead but none at the
sides.</p>

<p class="mt2">The chief exception to ordinary conditions was
the pilgrim-ship for Jerusalem in the days, which
ceased during this period, when special galleys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>ran from Venice to Jaffa and back, in the summer.
Here alone could the passenger have the upper
hand, since these galleys alone were passenger-boats
primarily. The captain would be willing,
if asked, to bind himself in writing before the
authorities at Venice, to take the pilgrim to Jaffa,
wait there and bring him back, call at certain
places to take in fresh water, meat, and bread,
carry live hens, a barber-surgeon, and a physician,
avoid unhealthy ports such as Famagosta, stay
nowhere longer than three days without the consent
of the pilgrim, receive no merchandise which
might inconvenience or delay him, provide two
hot meals a day and good wine, and guarantee the
safety of any belongings he might leave in the
galley during his absence at Jerusalem. No agreements,
however, seem to have insured the pilgrim
against starvation diet, and therefore it was
prudent to store a chest with victuals, especially
delicacies, and lay in wine; for, Venice once left
behind, wine might be dearer or even unobtainable.
Taking victuals implied buying a frying-pan,
dishes, big and little, of earthenware or
wood, a stew-pot, and a twig-basket to carry
when he landed and went shopping. Likewise a
lantern and candles and bedding, which might be
purchased near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark's; a feather-bed, mattress,
two pillows, two pairs of sheets, a small
quilt, for three ducats; and all of these will be
bought back at the end of the voyage at half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>price. Medicines he must on no account forget.
Care had to be taken, too, in choosing a position,
not below deck, which is "smouldering hot and
stinking," but above, where both shelter, light,
and air were to be had; this, of course, for the
benefit of such as were unable to secure a place
in the stern-cabins.</p>

<p>If the passenger did not find himself in a
position to get these counsels of perfection carried
out, this is what he would experience: "In
the galley all sorts of discomfort are met with:
to each of us was allotted a space three spans
broad, and so we lay one upon another, suffering
greatly from the heat in summer and much
troubled by vermin. Huge rats came running
over our faces at nights, and a sharp eye had to
be kept on the torches, for some people go about
carelessly and there's no putting them out in
case of fire, being, as they are, all pitch. And
when it is time to go to sleep and one has great
desire thereto, others near him talk or sing or yell
and generally please themselves, so that one's
rest is broken. Those near us who fell ill mostly
died. God have mercy on them! In day-time
too when we were all in our places busy eating
and the galley bore down on the side to which the
sail shifted, all the sailors called out 'pando,' that
is, 'to the other side,' and over we must go; and
if the sea was rough and the galley lurched, our
heads turned all giddy and some toppled over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>and the rest on top of them, falling about like
so many drunken yokels. The meals the captain
gave us were not exactly inviting; the meat had
been hanging in the sun, the bread hard as a stone
with many weevils in it, the water at times stank,
the wine warm, or hot enough for the steam to
rise, with a beastly taste to it; and at times, too,
we had to do our eating under a blazing sun....<a name="Anchor-27" id="Anchor-27"></a><a href="#Footnote-27" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 27.">[27]</a>
Bugs, etc., crept about over everything."<a name="Anchor-28" id="Anchor-28"></a><a href="#Footnote-28" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 28.">[28]</a> Another,
after many similar complaints, of cold food and
warm drink, and of sailors who walked about on
top of him when he wanted to sleep, and so on,
adds a fresh one, quite unmentionable, and then
goes on that he passes over the more disgusting
features so as not to discourage intending pilgrims.</p>

<p>The disappearance of the pilgrim galley was
more gain than loss, but it had the advantage
of more variety in the company and the voyage,
and probably, of a bigger ship; Moryson's ship
was 900-tons and Della Valle's Gran Delfino was
a great war galleon, with forty-five cannon and five
hundred passengers,—too many, it proved; in the
end twenty or thirty fell ill every day and some
died. And the mixture that there was! Men and women,
soldiers, traders, Greeks, Armenians, Turks,
Persians, Jews, Italians from almost every state,
French, Spanish, Portuguese, English, Germans,
Flemings. In Moryson's boat there were Indian
sun-worshippers as well. In another, Moors and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>Muscovites. Every day in the Gran Delfino a bell
was rung for prayer, when each man prayed in his
own way; prayer over, the sailors, all Greeks, turned
bareheaded to the East and cried three times,
"<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Buon' Viaggio</span>!!!" and the captain preached a
non-sectarian sermon. With the Gran Delfino,
moreover, the start was an impressive function;
the vessel, belonging as it did to the State, being
towed beyond the lagoons by thirty-three eight-oared
boats, directed by a venerable signor deputed
by the authorities. Once outside, however,
and left to itself, it was less impressive, at the
mercy of a wind so uncertain that it crossed the
Adriatic from shore to shore twenty-five times.</p>

<p class="mt2">In reckoning the length of voyages it would
not be sufficient to multiply the delay by bad
weather that took place in the Channel crossings
by the extra mileage of a given distance; there
was the additional delay due to the difficulty of
obtaining a ship at all, even in the best of weathers,
a difficulty proportionate to the length of the
voyage. The first-mentioned difficulty must not
be minimised; it was reasonable caricature for
Sir John Harington, Queen Elizabeth's godson,
to represent his Rabelaisian hero as returning
from "Japana near China" in a "24-hours sail
with some two or three odd years beside." And
by way of illustration it may be added that one
and the same voyage—from Messina to Smyrna—took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
one man thirteen weeks and another
thirty-five days; and that whereas the usual
length of the pilgrim voyage from Jaffa to Venice
was under five weeks, one band of pilgrims whose
return journey was delayed till the winter storms
caught them, were continuously at sea, or continuously
trying to be at sea, from September 19th
till January 25th. Yet another cause of delay, in
the Mediterranean, at least, was the Italian custom
of paying the sailors by the day; English
ships, payment on which was at so much a voyage,
were by far the quicker.</p>

<p>To return to difficulty number two, that of
obtaining any ship, instances of it are continually
occurring. Consider the complaint that one
Greenhalgh writes to his friend<a name="Anchor-29" id="Anchor-29"></a><a href="#Footnote-29" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 29.">[29]</a>—how he wished
to go by sea to Naples or elsewhere in Italy,
went to the Exchange at London almost daily
for a month to read the ships' bills hanging there;
could find none to take him; took passage at
Blackwall on one that was bound for Dunkirk,
but which the wind carried along the coast of
Norfolk; reached Dunkirk in four days and four
nights; no ship to be found there Italy-bound;
nor at Gravelines; nor at Calais; so came back:
seven weeks wasted.</p>

<p>But it may reasonably be asked, why didn't
he go by land? Well, that is a question without
an answer; but for any journey where the mileage
by sea was near the mileage by land, men of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>experience of these days reckoned it safer and
quicker and consequently cheaper to go by sea.
Once when Sir Henry Wotton, who exhaled sixteenth-century
wisdom whenever he spoke, was
at his favourite occupation of holding forth to
the Venetian Signory on things in general, we
find him taking it for granted that Poland and
Hungary were far from Venice as compared with
England and Holland; an exaggeration, no doubt;
but an exaggeration that stood no chance of being
believed would not have served his purpose. And
it would be just plain fact to say, with regard to
Danzig and Paris, and every other similar journey,
the sea for choice; even from Genoa to Rome,
amid all the danger of captivity for life by Barbary
pirates, there was a daily service of boats in
1588 according to Villamont; it was the more
usual route. Howell, indeed, leaving Paris for
Spain, went to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Malo to find a ship, but the
ordinary route was to go down the Loire to
Nantes, and by sea thence.</p>

<p>In the same way, from Rome to Barcelona was
usually made a sea-trip, although the sailors
coasted instead of going direct. All voyages in
fact were coasting voyages whenever possible;
no landsman was more scared of the open sea
than the average sailor during this period, the
greatest for the exploration of oceans that the
world has ever seen, except, perhaps, that unknown
age when the islands of the Pacific were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>colonised. The fear was based on an accurate
knowledge of their own incapacity, revealed to
us by one or two travellers who were interested
in the science of navigation. A certain Frenchman
embarked at Vannes for Portugal; no bearings
were taken, and the pilot had no chart;
trusted to his eye for his knowledge; which resulted
in his coasting along Galicia under the
impression it was Asturias. So with the master
of the Venetian ship that Lithgow sailed in;
he had no compass, cast anchor at night and
guessed his whereabouts in daytime by the hills
he recognised; on his way back from Alexandria
a storm drove them out of their course and he
describes, in his doggrel verse, the sailors spending
hours identifying headlands, only to find themselves
mistaken. Indeed, there was no satisfactory
method of ascertaining longitude at sea;
although European rulers were offering rewards
to the inventor of a method, no one was successful
in trying to solve the problem, not even Galileo.<a name="Anchor-30" id="Anchor-30"></a><a href="#Footnote-30" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 30.">[30]</a>
So habitual a practice was coasting that if a ship
was intent on avoiding a pirate the surest plan
was to keep to the open sea.</p>

<div class="caption">SHIP FOR A LONG-DISTANCE VOYAGE</div>
</div>

<p>But for the most part they seem to have
trusted to luck with regard to piracy, knowing
pirates to be as likely to be met with as storms.
The two chief centres were Dunkirk and Algiers,
and as the Dunkirkers and Algerines met in the
Atlantic, the Baltic was the only European sea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>free from them, during the latter half of this
period at least. In the earlier, war was so continual
as to provide employment, or pretext, for
the bulk of the scoundrels and unfortunates of
the continent whom the comparative peace that
succeeded turned loose on commerce, and consequently
on tourists.</p>

<p>It was bad enough in the Channel before this.
In 1573 the Earl of Worcester crossed with a gold
salver as a christening present for Charles <abbr title="the ninth">IX</abbr>'s
daughter; the ship was attacked by pirates;
eleven of his suite were killed or wounded and
property worth five hundred pounds stolen. In
1584, Mr. Oppenheim states, the French ambassador
complained that in the two preceding
years English pirates had plundered Frenchmen
of merchandise to the value of two hundred
thousand crowns: the answer was that the English
had lost more than that through French
pirates. So in 1600 we find the Mayor of Exeter
writing up about the Dunkirkers, "scarce one
bark in five escapeth these cormorants."<a name="Anchor-31" id="Anchor-31"></a><a href="#Footnote-31" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 31.">[31]</a> Repression
that was exercised by the governments
on both sides of the Channel had the effect of
making the Mediterranean worse than it had
been, for the pirates, especially English, not only
followed their occupation there themselves but
taught the Turks and Algerines far more about
navigation than the latter would have discovered
by themselves. Which, by the way, had a further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>result adverse to English tourists, for the Italian
states that had previously been favourably inclined
to England, Venice and Tuscany, both of
European importance, grew unfriendly; Tuscany
becoming definitely hostile.</p>

<p>But the state of the Mediterranean for men of
all nationalities was such that it would probably
be difficult to find a detailed account of a voyage
during the first half of the seventeenth century
which does not mention meeting an enemy.
What might happen then is best illustrated in the
experience of a Russian monk of rather earlier
date: "half-way, a ship full of pirates attacked
us. When their cannon had shattered our boat,
they leapt on board like savage beasts and cut
the ship's master to pieces and threw him into
the sea, and took all they found. As for me, they
gave me a blow in the stomach with the butt-end
of a lance, saying 'Monk, give us a ducat or a
gold piece.' I swore by the living God, by God
Almighty, that I had none such. They bereft me
of my all, leaving me nought but my frock and
took to running all about the ship like wild beasts
waving glittering lances, swords and axes...."</p>

<p class="mt2">Storms also were accompanied by incidents
out of a present-day tourist's experience, to a
greater extent than would readily be imagined;
and this especially in the Mediterranean, where
a large proportion of the sailors were Greeks with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>vivid superstitions, and courage but one day a
year, that of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Catherine, the patroness of
sailors, when nobody ever got drowned. Other
days it required very little danger to make them
abandon themselves to despair and to all the
signs of it which were most likely to distract and
demoralise the more level-headed; one by one
their relics would go overboard in attempted
propitiation, and the tourist was in danger of
following in person if he was suspected of being
no good Christian and therefore the probable
cause of the storm. Such is the recorded experience
of more than one; and a priest who had been
in the habit of reading a Bible was threatened
with ejection as a sorcerer, and his books with
him; fortunately the storm abated when the sailors
had reached that point.</p>

<p>It may safely be said that control of the weather
by sorcerers was altogether disbelieved in by very
few persons then, but if the belief was held more
strongly along one coast-line than another, it was
round the Baltic rather than elsewhere. As late
as 1670<a name="Anchor-32" id="Anchor-32"></a><a href="#Footnote-32" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 32.">[32]</a> a traveller tells us how being becalmed
off Finland, the captain sent ashore to buy a wind
from a wizard; the fee was ten kroner (say thirty-six
shillings) and a pound of tobacco. The wizard
tied a woollen rag to the mast, with three knots
in it. Untying the first knot produces just the
wind they want; S. W.; that slackening, untying
knot number two revives it for a time; but knot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>number three brings up a fearful northeaster
which nearly sank them. "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Qui nescit orare, discat
navigare</span>" was a much-quoted phrase; truly
enough of one traveller, it would appear, seeing
he is reported to have prayed during a storm; "O
Lord, I am no common beggar; I do not trouble
thee every day; for I never prayed to thee before;
and if it please thee to deliver me this once, I
will never pray to thee again as long as I live."</p>

<p>Shipwreck had an additional danger when it
happened to a galley rowed by forced labour.
Cardinal De Retz gives a vivid picture of what
happened when the one he was in ran aground.
The whole bank of galley-slaves rose; in fear, or
to escape by swimming, or to master the vessel
amidst the confusion. The commander and other
officers took double-edged swords and struck
down all whom they found standing. Even a
mere landing was not without risk, for the custom
in force almost universally of asking every new-comer
officially his business, home, destination,
was still more the rule at the coast; this same
cardinal, when a fugitive landing in shabby
clothes at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sebastian, was told by the soldiers
he would probably be hanged in the morning,
inasmuch as the ship's captain had mislaid his
"charte-partie," in the absence of which every
one in the ship could legally be hanged without
trial.</p>

<p>And if they had their special sea-troubles of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>pirates and Greek sailors and small boats in high
seas, how much more certain was sea-sickness and
the length of its enduring. Lauder remembered
leaving Dover at 2 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. M.</span>—"What a distressed
broker I was upon the sea needs not here be told
since it's not to be feared that I'll forget it, yet
I cannot but tell how Mr. John Kincead and I
had a bucket betwixt us and strove who should
have the bucket first, both equally ready; and
how at every vomit and gasp he gave he cried
'God's mercy' as if he had been about to expire
immediately." For preventives nobody has anything
to suggest except, appropriately enough,
one Father Noah, a Franciscan, who prescribes
pomegranates and mint; and Rabelais, who says
that Pantagruel and company departed with full
stomachs and for that reason were not sea-sick;
a better precaution, he goes on, than drinking
water some days beforehand, salt or fresh, with
wine or meat, or than taking pulp of quinces, or
lemon-peel, or pomegranate juice; or fasting previously,
or covering their stomachs with paper.</p>

<p>Yet Panurge, who was always full or filling,
became sea-sick when the storm came. As a
picture of sea-sickness, Rabelais' account of
Panurge sea-sick is probably unsurpassed. "He
remained all of a heap on Deck, utterly cast down
and metagrobolised. 'What ho, Steward, my
Friend, my Father, my Uncle; ... O, three and
four times happy are those who plant Cabbages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>... they have always one Foot on Land and the
other is not far from it.... This Wave will
sweep us away, blessed Saviour. O my Friend,
a little Vinegar; I sweat again with sheer Agony....
I am drowning, I am drowning, I am dying.
Good people, I drown.... Ah, my Father, my
Uncle, my All, the water has got into my Shoes,
by my Shirt-collar. Bous, bous, bous; paisch;
hu, hu, hu, ha, ha, ha, I drown ... eighteen hundred
thousand Crowns a year to the man who will
put me ashore.... Holos, good People, I drown,
I die. <span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Consummatum est</span>; it is all over with me....
My good man, couldn't you throw me
ashore?'"<a name="Anchor-33" id="Anchor-33"></a><a href="#Footnote-33" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 33.">[33]</a></p>

<p>Sea-sickness was probably more common then
than now because the discomforts were so much
farther from being minimised. Moryson recommends
passengers to take rose leaves, lemons or
oranges, or the roots or the leaves of angelica,
cloves, or rosemary, to counteract the evil smells
of the boat; he might have added, of the company
too, more particularly with reference to river
traffic, because there the company was specially
liable to be mixed by reason of the cheapness of
that way of travelling as compared with horseback;
and because the contact with each other
was close.</p>

<p>It is not without signification that practically
all district-maps of this date mark the courses of
rivers, but not of roads. Probably few records
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>could be found of any touring of this period worth
calling a tour which was not partly conducted by
river. One advantage of river travel was that that
way was more regularly practicable than the
roads, which bad weather soon rendered barely
passable. Moreover, it was the pleasantest mode
of journeying, especially if the boat was towed;
for travelling in a sixteenth-century waggon produced
something like sea-sickness in those unaccustomed
to it. On the other hand, to get the
benefit of the cheapness of river travelling, as
compared with riding, one had to wait, at times,
for fellow-travellers to fill the boat; also, the
choice of route was, of course, more limited; and
on the swifter rivers it was not usual, or worth
while, to attempt an up-stream journey.</p>

<p>On the Loire, for instance, at Roanne, where it
began to be navigable, boats were all built for
sale, not for hire, as they were not expected to
come back; and the same practice was in use
elsewhere. But this must be taken as a rule with
many exceptions. On the lower Loire towing was
in regular use and Lady Fanshawe, who tried it,
right from Nantes to Orleans, says, "of all my
travels none were, for travel sake, as I may call
it, so pleasant as this." They went on shore to
sleep, but kept to the boat all daytime, for it
possessed a "hearth," a charcoal fire on which they
did the cooking. Where towing was most frequently
used was probably Russia, all by hand;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>sometimes as many as three hundred men were
being employed at once by Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>'s ambassador
for the six barges and one boat between
Archangel and Vologda.</p>

<p>When rowing was to be done, the tourist found
himself expected, practically compelled, to take
his share on the Elbe and the Rhine, and often on
other rivers too. The diarist Evelyn reckoned that
he rowed twenty leagues of the distance between
Roanne and Orleans, and no doubt Edmund
Waller, the poet, did the same, as he was one of
the party. If any exemptions were made, it was
the boatman who exempted himself.</p>

<p>Another poet, or, at least, verse-writer, was deserted
altogether by his boatman. This was John
Taylor, on his way back from Prague. He had
taken to the river at Leitmeritz, with his two
companions and some one else's widow and her
four small children, they having jointly bought
a boat forty-eight feet by three. It was at the
Saxony boundary that the man ran away, whence
there were six hundred miles to cover, past one
thousand "shelves and sands," eight hundred
islands, and numberless tree-stumps and rocks,
two hundred and forty of the islands having a
mill on one side, but which side was not visible
beforehand. His figures, however, need not be
taken too literally as he went "gathering," to
use his own words, "like a busy bee, all these
honied observations; some by sight, some by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>hearing, some by both, some by neither, and
some by bare supposition."</p>

<p>Equally exciting was Busbecq's passage down
the Danube in a boat roped to a 24-oar pinnace.
He was behind time, so they rowed night and day,
pulling hard against a violent wind. The bed of
the river was uncared for, and collisions with
tree-stumps were frequent; once it was with the
bank, so hard that a few planks came away. But
the ambassador got no further answer to his remonstrances
than "God will help" from the
Turkish rowers. The Danube was mainly a Turkish
river then.</p>

<p>On the lakes there were, of course, storms to
contend with, two of which nearly drowned two
of the most gifted men of the century, De Thou
the historian, and the artist Cellini. It is fairly
clear, too, that their almost identical experiences
took place on the same lake; that of Wallenstadt,
although neither of them gives the name. The
boat De Thou crossed in was made of fir-trunks,
neither sound, nor tarred, nor nailed; a German
was in it, too, with his horse, which fell about;
the helmsman left his post, called out to all to
save themselves if they could; nothing was to be
seen but rain and lake and perpendicular rock,
until a cave was sighted towards which all joined
in an effort to row. A way up the rock was found,
at the top, an inn, just where Cellini had found
one nearly half a century earlier.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
<p>On the rivers themselves there were two further
disadvantages to meet; delay through running
aground and danger in shooting the bridges.
The latter was very great: the bridge which gave
its name to Pont-<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Esprit on the Rhone was as
notorious a place for shipwrecks as any headland,
and no doubt it happened then, as it used to
happen later, at Beaugency, on the Loire, that
all card-playing and talking ceased from the moment
the boatmen began to prepare for the passage
underneath till the passage was safely over.
As for running aground, it did not happen so often
as might have been expected, to judge by what
is left unsaid by the travellers: one must not
strike any average from Peter Mundy's feat of
doing it forty times in two days.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 519px;"><a id="i_b_082fp"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_082fp.jpg" width="519" height="400" alt="LOCK BETWEEN BOLOGNA AND FERRARA" />
<div class="caption">LOCK BETWEEN BOLOGNA AND FERRARA</div>
</div>

<p>Both these drawbacks were present, nevertheless,
to a serious extent, and for the same reason;
the total absence of regulation of the flow of
water. Locks, or "sluices" as they were termed
then, were being introduced exceedingly slowly;
how slowly is evident from a Frenchman explaining<a name="Anchor-34" id="Anchor-34"></a><a href="#Footnote-34" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 34.">[34]</a>
the working in detail in his journal (without
the use of any specialised terms) of one on
the Reno, between Bologna and Ferrara. Considering
that he must have had much experience
of France and had by that time traversed all the
waterways generally used for passenger traffic
in Italy, it may be concluded that locks were at
least very rare in both countries. Some such deduction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>may also be made for England and France
from an Englishman doing the same when at
Montargis on the Loire, nearly seventy years
later.<a name="Anchor-35" id="Anchor-35"></a><a href="#Footnote-35" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 35.">[35]</a> Even in Holland, the nursery of the lock-system,
its development was slow. In 1605 a
Venetian ambassador mentions that the lock-gates
between Brussels and Antwerp were only
opened once a week, when the weekly trade-barge
went along; at other times every one had to change
boats at every lock; just as was done on the series
of canals formed out of the marshes between the
Reno and the Po, according to the Frenchman
just quoted. In the middle of the seventeenth century,
the same arrangement was in force between
Antwerp and Brussels, so Evelyn says, whereas,
he implies that between Bologna and Ferrara a
lock system was fully in use.</p>

<p>In canals, the great achievement of the period
was the cutting of one for nine miles between
Amsterdam and Haarlem in six months at a
cost of £20,000, finished not long before Sir W.
Brereton passed through it in 1634; the previous
route had been by a canal in the direction of
Haarlem Meer, the boat having to be lugged by
hand past the dam which separated the canal
from the Meer. Here, in Holland, too, was by far
the best passenger service in Europe; in many
cases boats were towed, or sailed, between town
and town every hour with fares fixed by the local
authorities, and the only complaint that is to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>heard concerns the drunkenness of the boatmen,
who frequently landed the passengers in the water.
But there is an isolated complaint, by an Italian
chaplain, which shows what the others accepted
as no more than reasonable. Nearing Amsterdam,
he and his passed the night in the open
barge, unable to sit up, much less stand, because
of the lowness of the bridges, but forced to lie, in
pouring rain, on foul straw, as if they were "gentlemen
from Reggio," a phrase that is still used
in Venice as a synonym for pigs.</p>

<p>Practicability, comfort, cheapness, and speed—for
all these qualities the water could more
than hold its own against the land under even
conditions; and a traveller from Italy to Munich
finishes his journey by raft down the Iser and
reckons himself a gainer in time by using that
means in preference to horseback.</p>

<p>It is in France, however, that the importance
of waterways reaches its maximum. Almost
every tourist's way from Paris, except that by
Picardy, lay along a line which a river traversed;
the windings of the Seine did not prevent it being
quite as convenient as the road; while the
Loire and the Rhone were far more so; and for
approaching Paris, the Garonne was very frequently
part of one route, even up to its mouth;
the upper Loire of another. An even clearer idea
of the importance and amount of usage of riverways
in France is gained by considering how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>Lyons has maintained a high and steady degree
of prosperity before, during, and since the
rise and fall of Venice and of Amsterdam, and
how at this period the only neglected parts of
France were those which lay between the chief
rivers, which have, in fact, so far dictated the
course to be followed by the main road routes
that the neglected parts of France are the same
now as then. To Lyons the Rhone gave access
to Italy, Spain, and Africa; twelve leagues away
the Loire becomes navigable, and from Gien on
the Loire was one day's journey to a tributary
of the Seine, the Loing: which three rivers put
Lyons in touch with North Spain, most of France
and all northern Europe. Neither was Lyons very
far from the Rhine and the Danube.</p>

<p>In Spain alone were the rivers unused by the
traveller. In southern Italy they were less used
than in Roman times, when passenger traffic was
customary on the Tiber and smaller rivers,<a name="Anchor-36" id="Anchor-36"></a><a href="#Footnote-36" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 36.">[36]</a> which
certainly was not the case three hundred years
ago; the disuse of the lower reaches of the Tiber
is accounted for by the fear of the Turks, to prevent
an attack on Rome by whom the mouth of
the river was closed. In North Italy on the other
hand, the Adige, Brenta, and Po are frequently
mentioned; the Po, indeed, from Turin must have
been as constantly in use as any river in Europe
in proportion to its length. From Mantua to
Ferrara in 1574<a name="Anchor-37" id="Anchor-37"></a><a href="#Footnote-37" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 37.">[37]</a> a boat sailed every night as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>matter of course; between Mantua and Venice
communication by water was regular in 1591, and
even from Milan to Venice it was quite an ordinary
thing to travel by the Po, finishing the journey
along the Adige to Chioggia by means of a
canal which linked up the two rivers. As for the
Brenta, it had its own proverb, that the passenger
boat (between Padua and Venice) would
sink when it contained neither monk, student, nor
courtesan, which is as much as to say that the
tourist would always find company, as well as a
boat, ready.</p>

<p>It is in connection with the waterways of North
Italy that one of the debated questions of Shakespeare's
life has arisen: as to how much, or how
little, he knew of Italy first hand. But hitherto
the commentators have been contented with so
little evidence that his references to them have
been misinterpreted and the accuracy of the impression
that they give, and would give still more
distinctly had his editors done him justice, has
been denied. A recent writer<a name="Anchor-38" id="Anchor-38"></a><a href="#Footnote-38" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 38.">[38]</a> has set out the facts
and some evidence so clearly that there is no
need to add to the latter further than has already
been done by the few instances just mentioned:
a few out of an almost indefinite number which
are to be found in the writings of these tourists
contemporary with Shakespeare, who are surely
the most satisfactory witnesses in a case like this,
wholly concerned with what he, if a tourist, would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>have seen. What they show is that in practically
every North Italian town passenger traffic by
water formed part of the daily life, and that is the
impression clearly shared by Shakespeare. When
he represents the passenger traffic in an Italian
river being dependent on the tide, it must be
remembered that he lived near old London
Bridge, where the tidal rush was tremendous; and
that for his purpose in writing accuracy did not
matter in the very least. Neither is any mistake
of his over routes to be compared with one of the
careful Villamont, who asserts that he reached
Este from Padua by the Brenta and that the
Brenta is navigable no farther than Este. Now
Este is southwest of Padua and the Brenta
reaches the latter from northwest and never gets
within seventeen miles of Este; but what is more
particularly to be noted is that Villamont's "Voyages"
was the book of European travel most frequently
reprinted in Shakespeare's lifetime and
that the error was never corrected. At the same
time, it is, perhaps, worth while laying stress on the
fact that no deduction can be made from all this
as to whether Shakespeare ever left England or
the reverse, because his capacity for using second-hand
knowledge was so unique that it may be
said of him as can be said of probably no other
writer, that it is impossible to make a reasonable
guess as to when his knowledge is first-hand
and when it is not.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>
<p>Another subject which needs to be treated
here, although at first sight it also seems out of
place, is that of the characteristics of the islands
of Europe as seen by foreigners; for among the
advantages of choosing the sea must be reckoned
acquaintance with those places which one would
never get a glimpse of without a voyage; that is,
those which ships touched at but which did not
form parts of the tourist's objective. Far and
away the chief of these were the islands of the
Levant. The opinion that the tourists have of
them is probably rose-coloured by the fact that
these broke the monotony of a longer voyage than
they had need of otherwise; but the fact remains
that all agree in depicting them as the spots where
human life was at its pleasantest. Of Chios, in
particular, might be used the childlike phrase
which the Italians used to express the height of
happiness,—it was like touching heaven with
one's fingers. Nowhere was there greater freedom
or greater pleasure. Such was Della Valle's
opinion, who calls it "the pleasure-place of the
Archipelago and the garden of Greece"; nothing
but singing, dancing, and talking with the ladies
of the isle, not only in daytime but up to four or
five in the morning. Their costume was the only
thing in Chios that could have been improved and
this seems to refer to the style only, for Lithgow
says that they were so sumptuously apparelled
that workmen's wives went in satin and taffety,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>and cloth of gold, and silver, with jewelled rings
and bracelets; and when he goes on to say that
they were the most beautiful women he ever saw,
it is worth remembering that he not only covered
more ground in Europe, but visited a greater
number of the islands of the Mediterranean
than any of the others. Besides, there are so
many to confirm it; and although three hundred
years ago there was little of what we call appreciation
of nature, or rather, of the modern custom
of definitely expressing such appreciation, there
was no lack of appreciation, and expression of
appreciation, of nature when taking a human
and feminine form. Singing, too, seems to have
been part of living hereabouts: in Crete, for instance,
the men, women, and children of a household
would usually sing together for an hour after
dinner. When there was a seamy side to their
life it was associated with politics; in this same
Crete Lithgow stayed for fifty-eight days and never
saw a Greek leave his house unarmed: generally
it was with a steel cap, a long sword, a bow, dagger,
and target-shield. In Zante, too, labourers
went to the fields armed; but then it must be
taken into account that the men of Zante were
peculiarly murderous; if a merchant refused to
buy from them his life would be in danger: and
also, it was under Venetian rule, a double evil;
first, because it had no other object than that of
benefitting Venetians, and secondly, it implied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>opposition to the Turks, which was worse, much
worse, than the rule of the Turks. Chios was
under Turkish rule; so was Coos, the next happiest
place, very rarely visited, but well worth it,
partly for what Della Valle calls the "Amorevolezza"
of that generation, partly because there
were still to be seen the houses of Hippocrates,
Hercules, and Peleus, Achilles' father. At Corfu
was the house of Judas; also his descendants,
however much the latter denied their ancestry;
and near Lesbos, the islet called Monte Sancto
because it was thither that the Devil had borne
Christ to show him all the kingdoms of the earth.
Then there were all the natural curiosities which
the tourist might see in the Levant and nowhere
else; asbestos at Cyprus, likewise ladanum "generated
by the dew," and at Lemnos the "terra
sigillata" famed throughout Europe for its healing
properties, an interesting example of an ancient
superstition taken over by Christianity; for
the priestess of Artemis who had the charge of
the sacred earth in Pliny's time had been succeeded
by the Christian priest whom the Turkish
officials watched at work without interfering, in
case there might be some rite which they did not
know of and on the use of which the efficacy of
the earth depended.</p>


<p class="mt2">So also, with volcanoes; it was only he who
went by sea who saw any other than Vesuvius;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>and in addition to their scientific, they had also
a theological, attraction, being generally considered
as mouths of hell, Stromboli, in particular, more
continually active than the rest. Concerning
Stromboli there is a curious tale which is worth
borrowing from Sandys, how one Gresham, a
London merchant, ascended the volcano one day,
at noon, when the flames were wont to slacken,
and heard a voice call out that the rich Antonio
was coming. On returning to Palermo where there
was a rich Antonio, well known, he learnt that
the latter had died at the hour the voice had been
heard, and the fact and hour were confirmed by
the sailors who had accompanied Gresham, to
Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII</abbr>, who questioned them. Gresham
himself retired from business and gave away his
property.</p>

<p>Another Levant incident, characteristic, mysterious,
and one of Sandys' telling, moreover,
is this. He was at Malta one day, alone on the
seashore, and what he saw seemed like a part
of a masque. A boat arrived; in it, two old women.
Out they stepped with grotesque gestures, and
spread a Turkey carpet, on that a table-cloth, and
on that victuals of the best. Then came another
boat which set "a Gallant ashore with his two
Amorosaes, attired like nymphs, with Lutes in
their hands." But the "gallant" turned out to
be a French captain and the nymphs far from
spiritual.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<p>Or again; once, on the way to Constantinople,
they were near land and he made a day's excursion.
Returning at evening, he found the captain
lying dripping wet, struggling, it seemed, with
death. The crew were all quarrelling, some on
board, some on shore. "Amongst the rest there
was a blind man who had married a young wife
that would not let him lie with her and thereupon
had undertaken this journey to complain unto the
Patriarch. He, hearing his brother cry out at the
receipt of a blow, guided to the place by the noise
and thinking with his staff to have struck the
striker, laid it on with such force that, meeting
with nothing but air, he fell into the sea, and was
with difficulty preserved from drowning. The
clamour increased; and anon the captain, starting
up as if of a sudden restored to life, like a madman
skips into the boat, and drawing a Turkish
scimitar, beginneth to lay about him (thinking
that his vessel had been surprised by pirates):
whereupon they all leaped into the sea, and diving
under the water ascended outside the reach of his
fury. Leaping ashore, he pursues my Greek guide,
whom fear made too nimble for him, mounting
a steep cliff which at another time he could have
hardly ascended. Then turning upon me (who
was only armed with stones) as God would have
it, he stumbled, and there lay like a stone for
two hours, that which had made them so quarrelsome
being now the peace-maker. For it being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>proclaimed death to bring wine into Constantinople
and they loath to pour such good liquor into
the sea, had made their bellies their overcharged
vessels."</p>

<p>But it would be doing the Levant injustice to
let the last word on it be an explained miracle,
and therefore you may be informed on the testimony
of John Newberie, citizen and merchant of
London, who, "being desirous to see the world,"
has become enrolled in the band of Purchas, His
Pilgrims, that there was a small isle near Melos,
to wit, the <span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Isola de' Diavoli</span>, uninhabited but by
devils; and if any vessels are moored thereto, as
may be done, the water being deep by the shore,
the ropes loose their hold unless the sailors make
a cross with every two cables. And once upon a
time, when a Florentine galley was moored there
without a cross, a loud voice was heard warning
the sailors to row away.</p>

<p>And lastly, this is what happened when a funeral
had to take place at sea; an inventory of the
deceased's goods was made, the ship's bell was
rung twice, a fire-brand thrown into the sea, and
the announcement made: "Gentlemen mariners,
pray for the soul of poor —— whereby, through
God's mercy, he may rest with the souls of the
faithful." But it is pleasant to say that on the
only occasion this form of burial is recorded the
deceased was alive, if not kicking; he was at his
post, the "look out," curled up asleep, as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>had been for forty-eight hours previously, sleeping
off the effects of Greek wine.</p>

<p>The amount of attention given to the other
islands of the Mediterranean, Sicily, which may
be considered part of Italy, excepted, might well
be represented by saying nothing about them,
but Cardinal de Retz's remark about Port Mahon,
Minorca, is too characteristic of his age to be
passed over; he praises it as the most beautiful
haven of the Mediterranean, so beautiful that its
scenery surpassed even that employed at Paris
for the opera!</p>

<small>EUROPEAN EUROPE</small></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From the report of divers curious and experienced persons I
had been assured there was little more to be seen in the rest of
the civil world after Italy, France and the Low Countries, but
plain and prodigious barbarism.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Evelyn</span>, <cite>Diary</cite> (1645).</p></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> route of the Average Tourist being
determined by the considerations above-mentioned,
he was naturally directed
to those countries whose situation enabled them
to influence the course of events in his fatherland,
whose development and conditions contained
the most pertinent lessons for him as a man and
as a statesman, and whose climate, accessibility,
and inhabitants were such as hindered travellers
least. These countries were: Italy, France,
the United Provinces (<i>i. e.</i>, Holland), the Empire,
the Spanish Netherlands (corresponding to Belgium),
England, Poland. This order is that in
which they would probably have appeared to arrange
themselves according to their importance
for the purposes under consideration. The omission
of England in the chapter heading is due, of
course, to Evelyn having started thence; of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>Empire and Poland, to the date at which he is
writing, near the close of the Thirty Years' War; a
date which, while within the period with which
this book has to deal, is later by nearly half a
century than the central date, 1600, to which all its
undated statements should be taken as referring.</p>

<p>Whatever criticism might have been passed on
this order of importance by this or that adviser,
not one would have been found to dispute the
preëminence of Italy. Whereas now there is no
form of human effort in which the inhabitants of
Italy have not been equalled or surpassed, it
seemed then as if there had never been any in
which they had been surpassed and very few in
which they had been equalled. So far as Art and
antiquities go, there will be no need to persuade
anybody of the likelihood of that; nor probably,
with regard to venerableness of religion or romance
of history. But the very easiness of imagining
the supremacy which would have been conceded
Italy on these points tends to close the enquiry
into the causes of its hold on men in times gone
by, and consequently to obscure the fact that
Italy then not only stood for all that Italy stands
for now, but also in the place, or rather, places,
now occupied by the most advanced States in
their most advanced aspects; for everything, in
fact, that made for progress on the lines considered
most feasible or probable at the moment; for
progress, not only in culture, but in commerce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>and commercial methods, in politics, in the science
of war, in up-to-date handicraft, and, especially,
in worldly wisdom. Even a baby-food was assured
of greater respect if made from an Italian
recipe, such as the paste made of bread-crumbs,
wheat-meal, and olive-oil, of which De Thou
nearly died. In short, if the value of Italy as the
colonizer of Europe in regard to mental development
belonged by this time to the past rather
than to the present, its reputation as such must
not be ante-dated, as is generally done, and ascribed
to the age when it most thoroughly deserved
that reputation. Here, on the contrary,
as usually, merit and credit are not contemporary.</p>

<p>And there was plenty to deceive those who did
not look far below the surface. In discussing politics
the newest set-phrases would be those
brought into use by Italian writers; "balance of
power," "reason of state," etc.; the word "status"
itself, as a substitute for "Respublica," was
both a sign of the times and of Italian influence.<a name="Anchor-39" id="Anchor-39"></a><a href="#Footnote-39" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 39.">[39]</a>
So with commercial terms, we find, for instance,
the word "provvisione" (commission) being used
as late as 1648,<a name="Anchor-40" id="Anchor-40"></a><a href="#Footnote-40" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 40.">[40]</a> by an Englishman who had
never been to Italy, while the control of Italy
over one of the later forms of the Renascence,
that of the art of gardening, is indicated by the introduction
of the word "florist" from the Italian
during the seventeenth century. The only modern
author, moreover, whose acquaintance a European
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>schoolboy was certain to make, was the
Italian versifier whom Shakespeare calls "good
old Mantuan," and even if we look at things from
to-day's standpoint the most remarkable professorship
of the period would surely be accounted
that of Galileo at Padua, 1592-1610. In another
respect, too, connected with education, the relative
maturity and crudeness of civilisation south
and north of the Alps is even more apparent to-day
than it was then. The "Trans-alpine" shared
more or less Erasmus' belief in the power of words
as a means of education, whereas in Italy, and
in Italy alone, was it insisted that the influence of
environment, personal and physical, is the factor
compared to which all else is of but little account.
The first theory is abandoned now by all who can
afford to do so, the second is that of the best
effort of to-day.<a name="Anchor-41" id="Anchor-41"></a><a href="#Footnote-41" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 41.">[41]</a></p>

<p>As for the technique of war, more than half-way
through the seventeenth century, when
Louis <abbr title="the fourteenth">XIV</abbr> wanted the very best available talent
to design the completion of the Louvre, it was to
Rome that he sent, and the artist, Bernini, is
recorded<a name="Anchor-42" id="Anchor-42"></a><a href="#Footnote-42" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 42.">[42]</a> as saying, to allay jealousy, that there
was no need for Frenchmen to be ashamed of an
Italian being called in for this purpose, seeing
that in the kind of knowledge in which they excelled
all Europe, that of war, their teachers were
still Italians. And the modernity of the latter's
reputation for supremacy in military knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>is thrown into relief by a remark of Bertrandon
de la Brocquière, writing in 1433, taken in conjunction
with the above. The latter was a clear-headed
Fleming of wide experience who, when
drawing up a plan for the right composition of
an army which should suffice to drive the Turks
back, only mentions French, English, and German
soldiers.</p>

<p>As regards applied science, again, we find
Evelyn writing of the harbour-works at Genoa,
"of all the wonders of Italy, for the art and nature
of the design, nothing parallels this." Now
Evelyn was certainly not a man to underrate the
rest of the wonders of Italy. As for comparisons
outside of Italy, all Europe had by his time settled
down to compete in the application of science
to every-day life. And as to the products of the
soil, is it not probable that if, nowadays, Europeans
left the soil to take care of itself, and the
day-labourer to take care of the seed and the preparation
of the product, Italy would regain the
first place as a producer of luxuries?</p>

<p>Such points as these, just a few that have
chanced to suggest themselves in the course of
reading for other purposes, are merely put forward
as typical of the relations existing between
Italy and the rest of Europe; the Italians themselves
admitted their own superiority by the
slightly contemptuous meaning that attached
itself to their word "Transalpini," and very rare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>is it to find one of these "Transalpini" taking the
view that Sir Philip Sidney and Fynes Moryson
did, that the first characteristic of Italy was pretentiousness.
On the contrary, it was assumed
that little but experience could be so easily, or
so satisfactorily, acquired elsewhere. Diverse
forms of government, at least, could not be met
with elsewhere in the same variety within such
narrow limits. The south was what they termed
a "province," <i>i. e.</i>, a dependency held down by
force, belonging to Spain; so, too, was Milan,
with its surroundings. In the centre was a monarch,
the Pope, who was both elected and "absolute,"
a term which had a specialised meaning,
that of power unlimited except by the extent to
which the holder made himself disliked. Further
north were free cities, Lucca, Genoa; six hereditary
principalities, Tuscany, Mantua, Urbino, Savoy,
Modena, Parma; and lastly, the Republic of
Venice with its miniature empire in Lombardy.
And concerning Venice, there is this to be noted,
that it was exhibiting solidity combined with
elasticity to a degree all the more astonishing in
"an impossible city in an impossible place";
which gave it a position not unlike that of England
to-day, namely, that peculiarities of its
"constitution" received an even greater degree
of respect than they were entitled to and tended
to be imitated by constitution-formulators of the
period who expected to reproduce what had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>achieved by geography and a national temperament,
by means of reproducing some of the formulas
that the latter had adopted. All of which was
of great interest to the Average Tourist; and in
consequence, if you happen to be reading one of
his accounts of a tour, at the first mention of
the word "Doge," skip twelve pages.</p>

<p>What remains to be seen concerning Italy is—what
were the details that mainly occupied
the foreigner as student there. In which connection
the chief fact to be noted is that his stopping-places
were invariably towns; and this not in
Italy only, but throughout Europe. As regards
the Average Tourist, this is fully accounted for
by the objects he set before himself, but it is
equally true of all. Bathing-places excepted, the
only holiday resorts lay in the very last places
where we should think of looking for them—in
the suburbs. The Riviera, for instance, was no
spot to delay in when Mohammedan pirates were
forever coasting along in search of Christian
slaves; and so on. But the essential explanation
is to be sought in a census of Europe. The population
of London exceeds that of most sixteenth-century
States, and there are London suburbs
which house more than any but the biggest sixteenth-century
cities. Many villages consisted
of no more than three or four houses; and even
near Paris, of six or seven or eight; in Spain one
might journey eight leagues without seeing a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>house at all. Whereas, therefore, the difficulty,
and the pleasure, of a modern tour consists in escaping
from people, the difficulty, and the safety,
of all tourists in 1600 lay in reaching them.</p>

<p class="mt2">Crossing the Alps, then, and making for the
towns, one came, say, upon Turin; not a town that
would detain one, but a point of the parting of
the ways. Hence to Rome, the direct way lay
through Genoa; a second viâ Milan and Bologna,
a day's journey longer but yielding the advantage
of seeing those two cities; while the third way, the
longest but most comfortable and no more expensive,
lay down the Po to Ferrara, thence to Venice,
thence by sea to Ancona, by land to Loreto, and
so to Rome. The two former routes converged at
Florence. Of these two the longer would be chosen
either going or returning. Milan must no more
be missed than Rome. It was the city of all Europe
on which the question of peace and war permanently
depended; being the key to the most debateable
district. And as such, it may be imagined
what the castle was then from what it is even in its
present state as a sort of museum of military architecture.
Then it was alive with the finest soldiers
of the age, Spaniards; a small town, complete in
itself, with rows of shops and five market-places.
And the city itself was recognised as unsurpassed
as a school both for the accomplishments that
befitted a gentleman and for craftsmanship; for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>everything, in fact, that made life possible or
pleasant. Yet Bologna had the advantage of it
in one respect, in possessing a University; to
matriculate in an Italian university continued an
inexpressible honour to the "Transalpini," evident
though it was that the merest smattering of
book-knowledge was sufficient to pass; and even
though the Italian said openly, "We take the fees,
and send back an ass in a doctor's gown." Florence
again, had its own supremacy; the most attractive
town in the district where the best Italian
was supposed to be spoken. Siena was preferred
by purists for language, but the slight distinction
was outweighed by just those charms which have
not been impaired by age. One more has indeed
been added that might be expected to have existed
then, but did not; what Ben Jonson wrote in
"Volpone" in summing up the qualities of the
poets of Italy and eulogising Guarini.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="stanza">
     <div class="verse">Dante is hard and few can understand him</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>was but an echo of the Italians' own opinion.
"Like Dante's 'Inferno' which no man understandeth"
was a Venetian Senator's description
of Henry <abbr title="the fourth">IV</abbr>'s policy in 1606.<a name="Anchor-43" id="Anchor-43"></a><a href="#Footnote-43" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 43.">[43]</a></p>

<p>Assuming the third route to be the one chosen,
there was Ferrara to pass, but not to stay at
when Venice was almost in sight—Venice in
1600! to have been a witness of that would make
it well worth while to have been dead for the past
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>three hundred years. The essence of the change
is best expressed in the words of Mr. L. P. Smith
in his "Life and Letters of Sir Henry Wotton,"
when he speaks of it as "a shell on the shores of
the Adriatic deserted by the wonderful organism
that once inhabited it." Outward and visible
signs of the vividness and breadth of its life were
two in particular; the infinite variety and number
of persons and nationalities that filled its streets
with colour and contrast and a sense of new worlds
and of mystery in the midst of commerce; and
secondly, the Arsenal. In all Europe there was
not such another organisation as the Arsenal;
not one so completely prepared with everything
that went to the fitting out of a fleet, and very few
so well able to fit out an army. Villamont was
shown twenty-five great galleasses and eighty-five
galleys, all of them so new that they had not
been out to sea. Probably, also, its managers
were the greatest direct employers of labour in
Christendom; 2880 is one of the more moderate
estimates of those permanently at work, including
the 200 old women always mending sails, a
number increased to 700 at times; and all these
employees were assured of a pension from the
State when past work, an otherwise unheard-of
custom then, in practice, at least. It had its
place, too, in the tourist's mythology; one after
another repeating the tale how when Henry <abbr title="the third">III</abbr>
of France visited Venice, a galley was built and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>three cannon turned out while he was at dinner.</p>

<p>Yet Montaigne has something to say about
Venice that cancels all the intervening years and
changes, and brings him into touch with us. He
went his way towards it with the highest expectations,
explored it eagerly, recollected it with the
keenest pleasure: yet at the end of his second day
there his feeling was one of disappointment. It
may be taken as characteristic that he alone should
experience then what seems more appropriate to
the present; more probably, other visitors shared
it but were too much subject to convention to say
so; or, perhaps, re-writing their experiences later at
home, as they generally did, they record their later
thought only, whereas Montaigne left his unrevised
and unashamed. This explanation seems the
more reasonable inasmuch as the causes of the feeling
had already come into being. On the surface
the sight rested satisfied, while the imagination remained
as hungry as ever. In a country, France,
for instance, the tourist always had a consciousness
of towns and districts unseen, all of which had contributed
to the past, for evidence of the existence
of which the imagination looks, however unconsciously;
but after two days in Venice, all that is
important and visible may seem to have been seen;
no suggestion of anything beyond, not even the
ruins of a half-buried city, as at Rome. It is true it
was clear then that the word "Venice" meant an
Empire as well as a city, though by the time the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>tourist had reached the city, he had passed through
the conquests, barring an island or two in the Levant
which the Turks were in course of subtracting.
Yet the third meaning of the name was as dim to
him as both the second and the third are to most
of us, that of the source of an Empire, the whole
collection of islands in the lagoons, whose larger
life had already been drained away into the central
settlement, but where Venice and its history
were equally discoverable—but not in two days.</p>

<p>Another similarity between Venice of old and
of to-day lies in the fact that the gondoliers knew
much better than the visitors whither the latter
wanted to go and took them there, with, or
against, orders; only with this difference, that
then it was always to the house of the courtesan
in whose pay he was.</p>

<p>When the tourist had released himself and was
proceeding on his way to Rome there were the
beacons dotted along the coast for him to notice,
beacons for signalling the sighting of a Turk or
corsair vessel from south to north in a few hours.
Ravenna received little notice, Rimini less, but
Ancona was kept in the memory by one of those
rhymes characteristic of the contemporary guide-book.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>And then Loreto. Here it must be remembered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>first of all, that it was unpardonable to ask for a
meal before visiting the "Santa Casa." The town
was little more than one long street, well fortified
by reason of the treasure that the offerings
represented. Bassompierre relates in his memoirs
how he was invited to be one of the witnesses at
the quarterly offering of the poor-box one Christmas;
the contents amounted to 6000 crowns (in
our money about £7500); this for one quarter
only. Many men, and towns too, were represented
by models of themselves in solid silver. As to
which votive offerings Montaigne makes an assertion,
unconfirmed by any one else but with this
in its favour, that no tourist but himself gives any
details concerning a valuable offering from himself
made at Loreto. He says that the craftsmen
refuse to take any payment for such articles beyond
the cost of the materials. It seems incredible
that a town which had been the resort of pilgrims
for more than two centuries should not have become
demoralised, but Montaigne adds that the
officials refused tips, or received them unwillingly;
and certainly no one complains of extortion.</p>

<p>If the tourist was lucky enough to see a shipload
of pilgrims arriving from the farther coast
of the Adriatic, it would be worth while to stay
and watch, for as soon as Loreto came in sight
they rose and cried out without ceasing from that
moment until they reached the "Santa Casa,"
beseeching the Madonna to return to Fiume,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>where, once upon a time, so the tale ran, her
house had stood. Leaving Loreto, not forgetting,
of course, to wear the pilgrim's badge peculiar to
the shrine—a leaden image of Our Lady surmounted
by three porcupine quills fastened together
with a silk thread, a tiny flag on each
quill—leaving Loreto, then, a détour was often
made to visit Assisi, joining the main road again
at Spoleto. And so to Rome, where the new arrival,
if a Roman Catholic, should first make his
way to the Scale Sante to return thanks for his
preservation during the past journey; where, too,
at his departure, he should pray for assistance on
the one to come.</p>

<p>It made considerable difference to his recollections
of Rome what date it was within this
period that he arrived. If at the beginning, he
would have found <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter's half-finished and
the interior in a state better suited to a pig-sty;
and the rest of the city to match; the most confident
Protestant would be gratified to find himself
scandalised beyond expectation. By 1601
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter's was practically in all its glory, the
city unsurpassed in its care for the needy and
sick, and of average morality. In the interval, too,
the catacombs had been discovered, and though
Bosio, the explorer of them, did not publish the
results of his explorations till 1632 they became
more accessible meanwhile; continuing, however,
to be regarded as isolated "crypts." It was his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>book "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Roma Sotterranea</span>" that first caused them
to be considered collectively; and it was under
that name that Evelyn paid his visit to them
in 1645, the first of these tourists to make
anything that can be called an excursion among
them. He entered through a burrow in a cornfield
two miles from the city, so small that he had
to crawl on his stomach for the first twenty paces.
But the main feature of the Rome of 1600 was
still its power. Not simply influence in the present
as a result of power in the past, but the
strength of age, middle-age, and youth existing in
unison. To begin with, their reverence for Ancient
Rome was greater than ours; an effect partly of
their theory of history, partly of the narrower limits
of their acquaintance with the materials of history.
For the former cause, it was bound to be
an axiom of history as long as the Bible remained
authoritative as a statement of historical fact,
that mankind had proceeded from good to bad,
and from bad to worse, as time had advanced.
And whatever, in the thought of the age, tended
to shake this view, was held in check by the discoveries,
in different, previously unexplored, parts
of the world, of communities which seemed to be
possessed at once of a higher morality and also
of a more primitive civilisation, than the European.
It is probably impossible for us to realise
the alteration that the theory of evolution has introduced
into current ideas about history.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>
<p>For the second cause, the greatness of the Roman
Empire appeared the greater for their having
so little with which to compare it. The empire
of the Ottomans had, it is true, by now
eclipsed it; but Spain's was a vague wilderness,
inhabited by savages; the Persian of old they
only knew through the doctored accounts of the
Latin writers; and of the overwhelming antiquity
and extent of the Chinese they had no real
knowledge at all. All, the Turkish excepted, that
were not shadowy to them, were what Rome had
obliterated, the moral effect of which, associated,
as it must needs be, with the name of the city,
endured as the chief asset of the Papal power.
If any one then had taken Gibbon's view, that the
remains of the Roman Empire were approaching
dissolution, it would only have been because he
thought that the end of the world was equally
near. And this unbroken continuity of power
did not merely exist, but was alive with fresh
life. Nothing had replaced Rome; there was nothing
to replace it; there was no need to replace
it, since there was nothing effete nor slack about
it, however much corruption was patent to the
"Reformed."</p>

<p>The relations between visitors who were "Reformed"
and Rome is another interesting feature
of the tourist-life of the time when both were
militant and a large proportion of tourists anti-Catholic.
Much depended on the reigning Pope.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>In the time of Sixtus <abbr title="the fifth">V</abbr> (1585-90) Protestants
came in fear, lived in disguise, and sought protection;
Englishmen from Cardinal Allen, who
readily granted it for a few days, to enable them
to see the antiquities. Clement <abbr title="the eighth">VIII</abbr> (1592-1605)
was much more lenient, yet Moryson thought it
advisable even then to pass for a Frenchman,
and to safeguard himself through Cardinal Allen,
as well; also to leave before Easter, when there
was a house-to-house visitation to enquire if all
were communicants. Precautions, on the other
hand, might be overdone. It was all very well to
make a practice, as one did, of going through a
church on the way to his morning drink, in case
spies were about, but to tell one's host, as a certain
German did, on returning home from an
afternoon walk, that he had just been to mass,
when all the masses were said in the morning,
was going too far! And conforming to custom
had its own dangers, too, when it formed a habit,
as Moryson found, who, on entering a church at
Geneva, reached out his hand towards the poor-box
in mistake for the holy-water stoop to which
he had accustomed himself; all the more embarrassing
a mistake for his being in the company
of Theodore Beza.</p>

<p>Gregory <abbr title="the fifteenth">XV</abbr> (1621-3)—to return to the Popes—forbade
even the other princes of Italy to admit
any but Roman Catholics to their dominions;
and there were, besides, the already-mentioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>prohibitions from the authorities at home. The
state of affairs in general may be taken as that
suggested by the localisation of Shakespeare's
plays. Two-thirds of his scenes are laid abroad,
in Italy more frequently than elsewhere outside
England: yet his contemporary Italy is practically
always the North, the South being reserved for
the "classical" period. Nevertheless, it may safely
be assumed that the danger was not quite so
great as the fear, and that where the former was
incurred, the sufferer had only himself to blame.
Whether or no the high officials at Rome were
faulty in dogma or in virtue, they were usually
both men of the world and gentlemen. Montaigne's
belongings, for example, provided the
searchers with plenty of material for a charge of
heresy, but a short conversation overcame all
difficulties. And one William Davis, an English
sailor<a name="Anchor-44" id="Anchor-44"></a><a href="#Footnote-44" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 44.">[44]</a> who fell ill at Rome in 1598, found by experience
that a Protestant who was civil would be
cared for in a hospital free and given food and
money on leaving. The more usual kind of behaviour
has already been illustrated; only it must
not be imagined that the incautiousness and incivility
which turned the Protestant into a martyr
were less conspicuous among other sects. By the
law of Geneva a three-days stay was permitted
to travellers of every creed. The poet-philosopher,
Giordano Bruno, and the Jesuit missionary, Parsons,
both rested there; their zeal prescribed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>extremes of controversial outrage in return for
tolerance and courtesy.</p>

<p>But Rome and its associations have had more
than their share of attention. Imagine, then, the
traveller started on the invariable excursion to
Naples, the equal of Milan as a finishing school,
and one of the few cities with underground drainage.
Some, but not many, might go on to Sicily;
to Syracuse for the feast of Santa Lucia, for choice.
But what with robbers and corsair-raids, there
was no travelling there without a strong guard,
and the towns were so unsafe that Messina seems
to have been the first of European towns to evolve
a combined bank and safe-deposit under municipal
guarantee; established by 1611, when Sandys
noticed it. Those who did reach Sicily usually
visited Malta as well; small boats with five rowers
left about two hours before sunset, and if no Turkish
sail was sighted, went on, reaching Malta
about dawn.</p>

<p>But the foregoing presupposes the Mont-Cenis
route into Italy, and leaves out three towns which
must be included: Padua, Verona, and Bergamo.
Padua had its university, the most-visited in Europe;
Verona, its relics of Roman times, which commanded
an attention that they now have to share
with the romantic aspects of mediæval history,
romance that sixteenth-century people were not
inclined to be attracted by, having too first-hand
an acquaintance with feuds to look at their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>picturesque side. Moreover, the visible remains
of these feuds, here and in every Italian city,
showed a ludicrous side, for in so far as they did
not take the form of assassination by the foulest
means, they consisted in the two parties of retainers
parading the town, armed with an absurd
completeness, each one confining itself to certain
quarters of the town by tacit agreement in order
to render collisions impossible. The habits dramatised
in the first scene of "Romeo and Juliet"
are those of Londoners, in so far as they are at all
contemporary. The third town, Bergamo, thousands
pass by now, year by year, within a few
miles, never knowing what they miss by not stopping,
but then it lay on the north-and-south road
as much as any town in Italy, and not even the
Frankfort fair surpassed that of Bergamo, August
25 and the following week, when lucky was
he who could find sleeping-room in a stable.</p>

<p class="mt2">Yet however complete was the outfit obtainable
across the Alps, there remained other countries
which were factors in politics; and which
possessed, moreover, histories, courts, universities,
and men of learning; fewer temptations, possibly,
and more "true religion." Of these France
was the one the most easily accessible to a greater
number. As to its boundaries, they were somewhat
narrower in almost every direction than at
present; especially southeastwards; Lyons was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>a frontier-town. Its attractions lay principally
in Paris, the only city north of the Alps comparable
to Milan as a centre for the training of a man
for a courtly, or an international, life; and in the
government, which, in its extreme centralisation
and in its idealisation of monarchy, corresponded
most closely with the more practicable ideals of
the day.</p>

<p>In planning a route through France it was advisable
to go straight to Paris, if only for a few
days, since to have been in Paris gave one a position
in the provinces. As a place to stay at,
Orleans was really far more frequently chosen
by foreigners than Paris. Its university was as
international as any in Europe, and ahead of any
other in maintaining a circulating library for
students, which lent any book on a receipt being
given for it; "an extraordinary custom" says
Evelyn. Here, too, began the district reputed
best for spoken French, which brought strangers
to stay at Blois and Tours and Saumur as well;
to Saumur, perhaps, more than to the other two,
by reason of the number and quality of its teachers
on all subjects; it was a centre for Protestantism
and learning in combination. Poictiers for
law, Montpellier for medicine; and there is an
end of the towns that the student-tourist abided
in. For the country in general it should be added
that just here, where centralisation and autocracy
were developing most rapidly and thoroughly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>was reckoned as the most decidedly free
region of Europe, "liberty," according to sixteenth-century
standards, depending not on administration
being either lenient or constitutional,
but on the extent to which the individual was not
interfered with by social conventions. Political
tyranny was not regarded as objectionable on principle,
except by authors.</p>

<p>The United Provinces differed in no noteworthy
respect from Holland of to-day, so far as
territory goes, and during the earlier part of this
period attracted but little attention; but as time
went on and from imminent destruction they
escaped into independence, they drew the tourist,
first out of curiosity and subsequently as a
State which compelled the study of every one who
needed to observe the present and foresee the
future. Many minor interests, too, brought individuals
thither, as a result of Dutch enterprise.
We find, for example, Sir William Brereton surveying
the country in order to understand their
methods of decoying wild-fowl; and Sir Richard
Weston, who introduced locks into English rivers
and the rotation of crops into English agriculture,
learning both these novelties there. And though
no one as yet went abroad to study the possibilities
of practical philanthropy, there were many
who noted, with an admiration that doubtless
bore fruit, their charitable institutions of all kinds,
unequalled then outside Rome. In one respect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>they were ahead of Italy: the suddenness of their
prosperity resulted in the latest improvements
in laying out towns—wider streets and greater
regularity being more in evidence there than
elsewhere. So uniform was the appearance of
the houses, says one, that they seemed to have
been all built by the same workmen at the same
time; whereas the Italian towns, even in re-building,
made no such experiments, because the old
narrow streets formed the best safeguard against
the surprise-attack of which they lived in constant
dread, especially from the Turks' corsairs.
No one town could claim precedence, though
Amsterdam, even as early as 1600, struck De
Rohan as equalled by few in Europe for wealth
and beauty; it was rather the excellence and frequency
of the towns that occasioned remark—twenty-nine
fine ones within sixty leagues of
boundary; together with the number of storks
which the municipalities cherished, as animals
known to harbour a preference for places where
representative government flourished.</p>

<p>As for the Empire, it meant many different
things to different visitors. The variety of territory
and government was absolutely bewildering,
yet certain marked cross-divisions presented
themselves, such as the triple division of it into
upper Germany, Hansa League (with Saxony),
and frontier; the frontier being those districts
which were forever either meeting, or fearing, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>Turkish invasion. Then there was division according
to politics, Catholic, Reformed, Protestant,
to be studied by the Average Tourist for
purposes of alliance, and a third classification according
to form of government, the imperial authority,
venerable and increasingly vague; princes;
"free" towns. The first system of division has,
however, most in common with the greater number
of foreigners' interests, and of its three sub-divisions
upper Germany was paid the greatest
attention, partly because it lay across so many
routes, partly because there was so much to see.
It gives the dominant note to references to German-speaking
countries in the travel-literature
of the day, a note of peaceful energy and hopeful
prosperity. While not recommended to these
travellers' notice by a well-known past such as
the greater coherence of France and Italy had enabled
historians to evolve for them, those who
lingered there, as most did, saw that its possessions,
human and non-human, gave it a present interest
and a promise not surpassed elsewhere. The
Germany of the last fifty years of the sixteenth
century is practically ignored by modern English
historians: the story of its continual activity
and of its continuous relations with England contain
none of those sensational hindrances to the
advance of civilisation with which historians
concern themselves, but the frequent references
to those relations by the contemporary historian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>of Queen Elizabeth's reign, William Camden,
bear witness to the current opinion and knowledge
which found expression in the number of
visitors from all quarters and the attention they
devote to it in relation to that accorded to other
countries.</p>

<p>Among the towns of the Empire Augsburg was
easily first; its finest street was the finest street
in Europe, with roofs of copper; Nuremburg ran
it close in many ways but had nothing to show in
comparison with that one street. The cause of
Augsburg's preëminence was its being the home
of the Fuggers, the greatest financiers of Europe,
but with their decline one function of the town
that meant much in the way of attracting wayfarers,
that of being the General-Post-Office for
correspondence between Italy and Central Europe,
passed to Frankfurt. The frequency of the
use of stone as house-building material in these
towns of Upper Germany and the show of burnished
pewter and brass that was the pride of
each inhabitant of standing, who let his huge
hall-door lie open all day to exhibit it, were details
which the Average Tourist would not overlook
if he was observing as he ought where the wealth
and security prevailed that were valuable in an
ally. Thus did Strassburg fix itself in De Rohan's
recollections. Democracy, to him, was a barely credible
superstition; yet nowhere was he more courteously
treated, nowhere did he see completer preparations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>against a long siege, nor any better arsenal,
a model of cleanliness, orderliness, and efficiency.
Neither was it lost on him that amongst all their
collection of cannon there was not one for siege
purposes; their aim was defence, not offence. As
little to be ignored as the others was Ulm. A
feature of the age was the development of the
methods of water-supply in towns; Ulm was the
centre for this industry; even Augsburg's water-supply
had been planned there. And it was equally
the leader in woodwork.</p>

<p>Similar characteristics would be found repeated
on a somewhat less striking scale among
the Hansa towns, with Lübeck ranking first
in pleasantness by general consent. A specially
charming feature lay in the number of swans
swimming in the moats, though no Englishman so
much as mentions them; doubtless because the one
town that excelled it in this respect was London.
Going east, the various capitals would provide
each its own object-lesson, and, collectively,
would illustrate the absence of avarice among
German rulers as contrasted with the princes of
Italy. Saxony formed the only exception and
Dresden showed it. In spite of it being the last
big town that Hentzner visited, its armoury
aroused more enthusiasm in him than anything
except the gardens of Naples and the all-sufficiency
of Milan; and Moryson confirms this, adding also
that the stable was the finest he had seen, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>its 136 horses, all foreigners (the German horses
had another stable to themselves), each with a
glazed window and a green curtain in front of his
nose, a red cloth, an iron rack, a copper manger,
a brass shower-bath, and a separate cupboard
for his trappings.</p>

<p>No Protestant who reached Dresden would
miss Wittenberg, but the contrast must have
been painful; poor and very dirty; the dwellers
therein mainly students, prostitutes, and pigs,
recalling the verses in use concerning Angers—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
     <div class="verse"><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Basse ville, hauts clochers,</span></div>
     <div class="verse"><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Riches putaines, pauvres escoliers.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Leipzig was in favour for the purity of its German
and Munich for pleasure, but Prague was another
disappointment in spite of the Emperor living
there; few stone houses and the wooden ones
rough, and so filthy that the saying ran that the
Turks would never take it despite the feebleness
of its fortifications, because it was so well-guarded
by its stenches; much as a Frenchman remarked
at this time of Massa, between Genoa and Pisa,
that it had a castle, but its chief defence was its
fleas. Vienna was likewise far too well defended
to attract visitors; a frontier-town against the
Turks, always garrisoned by mercenaries and its
streets unsafe in consequence.</p>

<p>To go on to the Spanish Netherlands, they were
bound to be passed and re-passed in the course
of the work of Europe, for geographical reasons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>but still more so as a storm-centre of European
politics. Nevertheless, the tourist, however serious,
did not stay there long. The viceroy's business
was generalship, and consequently there was no
settled court: little to note, in fact, but the Spanish
infantry at work and the effects of that; towns
in ruins, dwindling trade. Yet the localisation
of the war was intermittent enough not to interfere
with the travellers from Upper Germany
making a practice of reaching France through
this district, according to Zinzerling, rather than
direct, a habit resulting not only from the attractions
that remained to Flemish towns, but still
more from the direct route through Burgundy having
become a highway of German mercenaries into
France.</p>

<p>Moreover, no one who knew his business as a
sight-seer omitted Antwerp. Trade and political
importance had for some time been deserting it
until it suggested to Howell in 1619 "a disconsolate
Widow, or a superannuated Virgin that hath
lost her Lover," but in 1600 it had not passed a
state of mellowness without stagnation, with
traces of its greatness fresh. Every visitor repeats
the same idea—"the most beautiful town
in Europe"; and not in the same formula, as
would result from the idea being a guide's commonplace,
but in words drawn from his own experience:
"as seen from the cathedral tower the
most beautiful town after Constantinople," says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>one; or Lithgow, extolling Damascus, "the most
beautiful city in Asia," compares it, for every
respect save style of architecture, to "that matchless
pattern and mirror of beauty, Antwerp." It
would seem to have been the first town to turn
its fortifications into promenades, laid out in
walks and planted with trees.<a name="Anchor-45" id="Anchor-45"></a><a href="#Footnote-45" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 45.">[45]</a> The citadel, too,
was the finest out of Italy, on the word of a Venetian
ambassador.</p>

<p>Elizabethan England, on the other hand, was
rendered still more remarkable by possessing
no fortresses at all. Two exceptions, Berwick and
the Tower of London, served but to call attention
to the rule, the Tower in particular, whose
out-of-date character in the matter of defences
greatly amused connoisseurs. One Venetian ambassador,
indeed, with this fact in his mind, together
with the miscellaneous character of its
contents, describes it as not so much a fortress
as a "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">sicuro deposito</span>"—a safe-deposit.<a name="Anchor-46" id="Anchor-46"></a><a href="#Footnote-46" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 46.">[46]</a> The
peacefulness which brought about this state of
things is still borne witness to by the large glazed
windows on the ground floors of Elizabethan
country-houses, but no foreigner remarks on that
in the presence of the other more striking points
that testified to it then. Foscarini, the successor
of the ambassador just referred to, had occasion
to traverse the length of England in 1613. Writing
home<a name="Anchor-47" id="Anchor-47"></a><a href="#Footnote-47" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 47.">[47]</a> he remarks on five facts concerning
the country he passes through which seemed particularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>noteworthy: (1) No unfruitful land
throughout; (2) Every eight or ten miles a town
comparable to a good Italian town (this was on the
post-road to Scotland); (3) Number of navigable
rivers; (4) and of beautiful churches; (5) No mercenary
soldiers.</p>

<p>To make it clear why the visitor should be so
specially struck by these features, it is necessary
to recall how differently matters stood abroad.</p>

<p>During this period two thirty-year civil wars
broke out in Europe, one in each half of the period,
the first in France while the Empire was at peace,
the second in the Empire while France was at
peace. Between these two came twenty years of
comparative quiet, but never a year when war
was not to be seen in progress, or its effects still
horribly new, in the course of a Continental tour.
Incidentally, it may be pointed out that this peculiarly
even distribution of peace and war gives
the writings of travellers in Europe at this time
striking value in relation to the effects of war and
peace, not only in themselves but also as to their
special characteristics in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. No tourist came into contact
with both wars; almost every tourist saw something
of one district under the influence of war
or of peace, while some other is seeing another
district in an opposite state. There remains,
therefore, in their writings, a continuous comment
on each other; so continuous and so unconscious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>as to leave no room for this or that man's bias to
influence the general impression.</p>

<p>Yet striking as the peacefulness of England
was, it probably lessened rather than heightened
what degree of attraction England possessed;
since with war so normal a condition, war and its
incidentals became a primary object of study even
to those who did not profess soldiership. Neither
did any but the Dutch need to learn the language
of the country, which was what induced so many
to make a lengthy stay in Tuscany and in Touraine.
Neither was England a thoroughfare.
Nor, even, were the recent achievements of Englishmen
more than a minor cause of the considerable
influx of visitors; not, at least, apart from
the idea which is best expressed, perhaps, in the
private letter of an Englishman writing from
Aleppo: "Your last letter made me exceeding
sorrowful, for therein you acquainted me with
the death of blessed Queen Elizabeth, at the
hearing whereof not only I and our English nation
[<i>i. e.</i>, the residents] mourned, but many
other Christians who were never in Christendom,
but born and brought up in heathen countries,
wept to hear of her death, and said that she was
the most famous queen that ever they heard or
read of since the world began."<a name="Anchor-48" id="Anchor-48"></a><a href="#Footnote-48" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 48.">[48]</a></p>

<p>For the "Virgin Queen" was a far greater
marvel to contemporaries than to posterity. Except
for her namesake of Spain, a century earlier,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>who throughout her political life had been the ally
and wife of one of the cleverest statesmen of the
age, there was no instance since the mistiest past
of a queen-regnant a leader of men. At her accession
civil war or conquest seemed inevitable and
insolvency was a fact: yet before her death the
bond of London "is," writes one of the chief financiers
of the time,<a name="Anchor-49" id="Anchor-49"></a><a href="#Footnote-49" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 49.">[49]</a> "the first to-day [1595] in
Europe," and she had added victory abroad to
peace at home. To say "she had added" suggests
nowadays the phraseology of the lady's paper, but
it does really express not only the convention
which the tourist may be taken as accepting but
also the belief of reasonable men of the time.</p>

<p>It is true that many denied her right to the
title of "Queen," or, indeed, to that of "Virgin";
but no one had the opportunity of doubting that
both claims belonged to that secondary order of
facts known as "historical." And just as her position
as sovereign, and a strikingly successful
one, was more wonderful then than it seems to-day,
so too did her celibacy assure her of more
reverence than we should instinctively concede.
The mediæval idealisation of virginity, one of the
most beneficial, perhaps, of all the ideas of the
past that the Reformation killed, ensured a place
in the life of the world, and the self-respect contingent
on that, for all the unmarried women
whose counterparts since have had no assistance
socially from any convention, from nothing but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>their own individuality. But this idea, though
dying, was not dead; and, as is the way with
ideas, challenged attention all the more definitely
for ceasing to be taken for granted.</p>

<p>These two facts, then, glorified Elizabeth in the
eyes of foreigners; first, that she was a queen and
a great ruler when effective queenship was half
a myth; secondly, that she remained unmarried
when virginity, considered as a virtue, was, so to
speak, due to have its last flicker before finally
dying down. The reign of James <abbr title="the first">I</abbr> was a sort of
after-glow, except in so far as he had a reputation
as a philosopher-king.</p>

<p>These ideas have a marked effect on the visitor's
itinerary. He hurried, as a rule, to London, and
thence, if the court was away, to that one of the
palaces which was in use for the time being. The
other country palaces, none far from London,
would receive a visit, at any rate Windsor and
Hampton Court; Oxford probably, Cambridge
possibly, and there an end. Of Scotland and Wales
it can only be said that the former was practically
ignored except by a few Frenchmen, as a
result of the ancient alliance; while to Wales they
paid as little attention as the semi-Welsh queen
did—none at all.</p>

<p>Among the foreigners who have given us their
impressions of England are several who have
much that is of interest to say and yet who seem
to have been entirely overlooked. Nevertheless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>these pages are already more numerous than the
relative importance of England warrants. Let
us therefore take but one, and that one the briefest;
the more so since he is the likeliest to continue
to be overlooked, writing as he did in Polish, from
which hitherto no translation seems to have been
made, not even in paraphrase.</p>

<p>Jakób Sobieski, the only man who was ever
four times Marshal of the Polish Diet, travelled
all over Europe in his youth. Henry <abbr title="the fourth">IV</abbr> of France
made a personal friend of him, and it was at Paris
that he spent more time than elsewhere, where,
eventually, he witnessed the assassination of the
king and was nearly lynched himself on the spot
by the mob who took it into their heads to regard
him as the murderer. However, he not only
escaped, but after justice had been done on Ravaillac
by his being torn asunder by horses, Sobieski
had an invitation to dinner from a bootmaker
who had collected certain pieces of Ravaillac and
was arranging a loyal dinner-party at which they
were to form the chief dish.</p>

<p>It was in the previous year (1609) that he
visited England in the train of Myszkowski, the
Marshal, negotiations being then in progress for
the marriage of James <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>'s daughter Elizabeth to
Wladislas, son of the King of Poland. Sobieski,
very young and very Catholic, was easily enough
taken in by appearances to speak of James <abbr title="the first">I</abbr> as a
model king, and to accept without question the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>declaration of the English Catholics that things
had improved greatly since the death of the "severe
and overbearing Queen Elizabeth." But
it must be borne in mind that the King had not
yet come to the bottom of the Treasury. One of
Sobieski's remarks—that the Palace at Westminster
is finer inside than outside—is an interesting
comment on the impoverishment of the
Crown that set in, if taken in conjunction with
the remark of Gölnitz of Danzig, less than ten
years later, who says exactly the opposite. In
comparing the palaces around Paris with those
of the English king, he says that the former are
fine externally, but contain many rooms in which
a respectable German would not care to receive
an acquaintance; cobwebs, unpolished woodwork,
walls in disrepair. One thing that scandalised
Sobieski greatly was that in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul's he found
buying and selling going on, a statement confirmed
by a Venetian ambassador here in 1607, who says
that London possesses many fine churches but
that these are mostly used for nothing but driving
bargains in.<a name="Anchor-50" id="Anchor-50"></a><a href="#Footnote-50" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 50.">[50]</a></p>

<p>Sobieski's business, however, lay at the court,
and the court was out of town: the King at one
palace, the Queen at another, Princess Elizabeth
at a third. On paying their respects to the last-named
a curiously characteristic thing happened;
her chamberlain met them and asked in what
language they would speak with the Princess,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>French, Italian, or Latin; she was equally at home
in all three. Myszkowski chose Italian. The occasion,
of course, was not a decisive one, but the
conversation turned on Wladislas, the most
anxious enquirer being an elderly lady-in-waiting
who wanted to know if he was tall; the Princess,
she would have them know, was tall, really tall,
not made so artificially, with high heels, etc.,
to prove which she raised her mistress's skirt until
they saw not merely blue stockings, but also saffron
garters and white lace.</p>


<p class="mt2">The last country of "European Europe" is
Sobieski's own country, but only the last because,
like England, it led nowhere. If omitted from a
tour it was omitted with regret and consciousness
of loss, being the largest monarchy in Christendom,
600 miles by 800, with a frontier reaching
to within 150 miles of Moscow and 100 of the
Black Sea; always on the verge of war, moreover,
and a paradise of aristocracy, three good reasons
for claiming the Average Tourist's attention, especially
as among this aristocracy was always to
be found a welcome and as high an average of
attainments and qualities as anywhere north of
the Alps. The statement, too, that it was not a
thoroughfare must not be taken as absolute. Negotiations
between the Tsars and the Papacy were
frequent and these of course implied journeys
through Poland by the friars whom the Papacy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>was wont to use as emissaries for long distances,
as being more accustomed to endure privation
and fatigue than bishops.</p>

<p>Besides, from southeast to northwest stretched
the high road from the Black Sea through Kamienietz
to Danzig, which one of these travellers assures
us was the most thickly-populated highroad
in Europe.<a name="Anchor-51" id="Anchor-51"></a><a href="#Footnote-51" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 51.">[51]</a> Danzig itself was one of the
great centres of world-commerce; so great that
its citizens were well justified in one detail of their
daily life that Moryson records, that of taking off
their hats as they passed the town hall. The commerce
was very varied, but its main export seems
to have been grain and its main import, Scotchmen.
Of these latter there were certainly thousands;<a name="Anchor-52" id="Anchor-52"></a><a href="#Footnote-52" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 52.">[52]</a>
in fact, from some date in the reign of
Stephen Bathory (1575-86) till 1697, perhaps
later, a "brotherhood" of Scots existed, recognised
officially; and boys of fifteen to seventeen
came over in such quantities and so often with
such disastrous results, that in 1625 an edict was
issued in Scotland prohibiting skippers taking
over any who had not been sent for or had not
500 marks. But these can hardly be reckoned as
tourists, travelling, as they did, Scot-fashion, on
the "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ubi panis, ibi patria</span>" principle, with the
object of sharing the retail-trade with Jews, so
successfully that there has long lingered in Eastern
Prussia the proverb, "<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Warte bis der Schotte
kommt</span>," alluding to the annual visits of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>pedlars. Many, too, can be traced as becoming
burgesses of Danzig, or of Posen.</p>

<p>Of visitors of the type with which this chapter
is more specially concerned, the reign of the
Henry who afterwards became Henry <abbr title="the third">III</abbr> of
France marks a starting-point, judging partly from
the evidence available before and after that date,
partly from the statement in the report of the first
resident Venetian ambassador there, Girolamo
Lippomano, who came in that reign, that Poland
was at that time an unknown land to Venetians.</p>


<p class="mt2">So much for the Average Tourist at work. Let
us now see how he spent his spare time. It goes
without saying that the degree to which the foreigner
enjoyed himself was more or less dependent
on the behaviour of natives. Let us see,
first, then, what reception he might expect.
Small boys, of course, are the same yesterday,
to-day and forever, but they were, if possible,
somewhat more outspoken then. An ambassador's
wife went to the Hague once, never again, "by
reason of the boys and wenches who much wondered
at her huge farthingales and fine gowns,
and saluted her at every turn of the street with
their usual caresses of 'Hoore! hoore!'" Concealing
herself from view was impossible, no cart
would hold her farthingale. And although with
all the detail that is poured forth concerning the
Venetian constitution, the feature in it which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>though informal, has outlasted all the others, that
of the limited despotism of the small boys, is ignored,
yet in practice it was felt; Sastrow, for one,
did not forget being pursued with "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Tu sei tedesco,
perciò Luterano</span>."</p>

<p>As regards the adults, Frenchmen, or any one
dressed in French fashions, had to beware of the
Italian towns where the French had been masters
for a time, and although Strassburg had a gate
on the west, any one coming from the French side
had to enter by the east gate. Commercial quarrels
were even more bitter than political. When, for
instance, the English removed their "staple"
from Hamburg to Stade, nearer the mouth of the
Elbe, it was not safe for an Englishman to be seen
at Hamburg after the citizens had reached their
mid-day stage of drunkenness. As for theological
enmity, a Roman Catholic was saying his prayers
one evening in Frisia with the windows open; an
old woman marked it and came across the street
to spit at his inn; the next morning she came
again, to spit at him, and he had to put up with
it for fear of worse happening.</p>

<p>With such exceptions as these there was not
much to be feared from the upper classes; nor
even, on the main routes, from the lower; in
Dauphiné, for instance, all classes were pleasant
enough, whereas at Rochelle strangers were
liable to be pulled off their horses if they did not
remove their hats when passing the guard at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>gates. The two worst towns for brutality towards
foreigners were, by general consent, London and
Toulouse. In the former, according to Giordano
Bruno, whose account only differs from every one
else's in being more picturesque, the shop-people
and artizans, on seeing a stranger, make faces,
grin, laugh, hoot, call him dog, traitor, foreigner,
the last name being the rudest they can think of,
qualifying him for any other insult. Should he
take the offensive, or put his hand to his weapon,
an army of ruffians seems to spring out of the
ground, flourishing a forest of sticks, poles, halberds,
and partizans. In a more playful humour,
one will pretend to run away behind a booth and
come out charging on the stranger like an angry
bull; if an arm gets broken, as happened to one
Italian, the bystanders shout with laughter and
the magistrate sees nothing reprehensible in the
affair.<a name="Anchor-53" id="Anchor-53"></a><a href="#Footnote-53" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 53.">[53]</a> Oxford was a change for the better, for
there it was only the students who behaved like
brigands; as they did at Carcassonne, too, where the
law-students insisted on tribute from visitors,—they
called it a "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bienvenu</span>,"—or if it was not forthcoming,
the contents of the visitor's trunks were
shaken out. Yet among those of Oxford, Zinzerling
makes an exception in the case of Queen's
College, where as soon as a foreigner is recognised
as such, he is brought an ox-horn full of beer.</p>

<div class="caption">VENETIAN MOUNTEBANKS</div>
</div>

<p>Such presents were customary on a very large
scale on the continent; in France they generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>consisted of wine and were presented to persons
of high rank only, but in Germany every gentleman
received gifts of drink and food which usually
cost more than their value in tips and dinners.
The higher the rank of the visitor, the greater
the quantity; the Infanta Clara Eugenia writes
home that at the stopping-places in her passage
through Switzerland the gifts require thirty or
forty men to carry them, who lay them at her feet
until she is surrounded by barrels and has the
greatest difficulty in preserving her gravity. At
Lucerne she received barley as well as wine, and
two oxen, both too fat to move. Many other
local customs had to be submitted to which have
died out since; such as ceremonies of initiation
into the freedom of Hansa League towns, which
were accompanied by practical joking; the obligation
on Protestants staying at Geneva to attend
service at 7 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. M.</span> whenever there was a sermon;
and so on.</p>

<p>Among these exceptional customs and regulations
should be mentioned those concerning
weapons in Italy. At Lucca no knife might be
carried unless blunted at the point; in the Papal
States, a sword was allowed, but no short, easily
hidden, weapon; in Venetian territory fire-arms
only were forbidden; elsewhere a license from the
local authorities had ordinarily to be obtained for
wearing a sword, and in Florence the license only
referred to day-time. This is Moryson's account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>of the regulations; before his time the regulations
were laxer, and later they became stricter, which
gave a great impetus to the poisoning trade; in
fact, the bakers in Lombardy were mostly Germans,
and those of Rome, Jews, the Italians being
unwilling to trust their fellow countrymen.</p>


<p class="mt2">Such subjects naturally suggest executions,
which formed one of the commonest and principal
"sights" throughout Europe. Lithgow
landed at the Piazzetta at Venice just when a
friar was being burnt alive there for getting fifteen
nuns with child in a year. It was in Venice, too,
that Moryson saw two young senators' sons, who
had had too uproarious a night, have their hands
cut off at the places where they had done the mischief,
their tongues cut out where they had sung
blasphemous songs, and finally beheaded by a sort
of guillotine in the Piazza. And when he was
staying at Leipzig, where, as was the custom in
Germany, adultery was punishable by death, a
case had recently occurred of a girl giving birth
to an illegitimate child in a church, during service.
It was under consideration when he left whether
an ancient precedent should not be revived to
meet her case, that she should be tied up in a sack
with a cat, a cock, a snake, and a dog, all alive,
and so drowned. To quote one more as a sample
of many, there is the detailed description of a
man being broken on the wheel at Hamburg, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>Taylor the "water-poet." The place of execution
was on a mound, so that the enormous crowd
could see well; moated, to keep the people at a
distance, and approached by a drawbridge which
was raised during the execution; the criminal was
drunk, according to custom. In Germany exceptional
criminals were on view for some days
before execution, nailed by the ears to posts.
Torture accompanying execution was common,
and branding and mutilation things that no traveller
could well avoid seeing. But none seemed
to want to avoid them: Evelyn went to the Châtelet
prison at Paris to look on while a prisoner
underwent legal torture. The only occasions that
seem to have struck them as too horrible was when
the headsman bungled matters: a Dutchman at
Paris saw one try sixteen times and then have to
be assisted. And as in the towns, so by the wayside.
Gallows and wheels bearing the bodies of
men and sometimes of women, dying, dead, or decaying,
were continually to be seen: Taylor says he
counted seven score between Hamburg and Prague,
and Moryson mentions a criminal hanging in
chains near Lindau, starving to death, with a
mastiff at each heel, in order that he might be
partially eaten before death.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="i_b_136fp"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_136fp.jpg" width="600" height="274" alt="PUBLIC EXECUTIONS" />
<div class="caption">PUBLIC EXECUTIONS</div>
</div>

<p>No less awful a sight, and no less frequent in
certain places, such as Marseilles, was the galley-slave,
naked except for a pair of breeches, shaven,
dragging behind him when ashore the chain fixed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>to his feet, treated worse than a beast, and yet
not necessarily criminal: at Leghorn was a tent,
at Naples a certain stone, where a man might
stake his liberty against a few shillings on a throw
of the dice. Among the few who obtained their
release by being bought out were those who, on
that condition, acted as deputies in the processions
of flagellants which tourists often mention: Montaigne
witnessed one at Rome with five hundred
persons in it. He, like others, was astonished to
note their unconcern; the scourging was genuine:
their backs were raw and bloody, the thongs of
the scourges adhering to each other with the
blood; yet so far from showing signs of pain, they
marched along, careless and talkative, in an
every-day mood.</p>

<p>Other forms of slavery were ordinarily met
with: at Naples an open slave-market was held;
at Lisbon, too, where men and monkeys were sold
side by side. And here and there one might come
across settlements of those who could not claim
all the benefits of the law. Zinzerling picked up
a cagot servant near Toulouse, a young man, well-informed,
who told him how his brother-outcasts
had just petitioned for permission to marry whom
they chose, offering to have their blood tested
to prove it no different from other men's. Those
who did not act as servants, lived by handicraft,
carpentering mostly; they were forced to dwell
in the suburbs, and nothing they owned was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>heritable except furniture, which was looked on
as sharing their taint.</p>

<p>But he does not mention the goose-foot badge
which distinguished them from "clean" persons.
The badge of the Jew, on the other hand, often
seen, is often mentioned, varying according to the
extent they had acquired influence and used it.
In Poland, thanks to the Jewish mistress of one
of their kings, they had almost equal rights with
Christians. Elsewhere, except in those places,
such as England, which they were nominally forbidden
to enter, a badge was compulsory; lightest
in Mantua, merely a bit of yellow lace tacked on
inside their cloaks, but generally a red hat for
the men and a red garment for the women: red
as betokening their guiltiness of Christ's blood.
An alternative colour was yellow, as in Rome, where
a short-sighted cardinal once mistook a red-hatted
Jew for a brother cardinal and obtained a change
of colour in order to safeguard himself against
being so polite again.</p>


<p class="mt2">But the tourist's leisure, so far, has been too
much occupied with blood and social damnation;
let us look for a lighter mood: let us see him at the
Zoo. Florence seems to have been the best stocked.
Rabelais saw two Zoos there, and this was not
an optical illusion of a credible kind, for he localises
them differently; one at the Palazzo
Strozzi with porcupines and ostriches as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>"stars"; one near the Belfry, boasting lions and
tigers. Moryson mentions one only, the Duke's,
containing five lions, five wolves, three eagles,
three tigers, one wild cat, bears, leopards, an Indian
mouse which could kill a cat, and wild boars.
After another fifty-year interval comes Evelyn,
who looks down upon all the animals housed together
in a deep court, a pleasanter confinement,
he thinks, than the narrow cages of the Tower at
London. But I have forgotten Audebert, who
should have come between (1576) Rabelais and
Moryson, and who found a Zoo near the "Annunziata,"
possessing fourteen lions, a tiger, an eagle,
and a vulture therein. In 1592 at Prague there were
twelve camels in the Emperor's Zoo, very probably
the sons and daughters of those whom Busbecq
brought back from Constantinople in the hope of
naturalising them in Europe as beasts of burden,—not
the only attempt of the kind, for Sir <abbr title="William">Wm.</abbr>
Brereton saw some so used in Holland, and a
German others near Aranjuez. The leopards,
moreover, in this same Imperial Zoo, were taken
to assist in hunting.</p>

<p>Experiments and novelties such as these, of
course, provided a larger part of the interest of a
journey then than is the case now, when such news
is communicated immediately through the newspapers.
We find Tommaso Contarini, ambassador
to Flanders, greatly struck by the value of peat
as fuel, and bringing back some to Venice to assist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>him in ascertaining if anything of the kind is
obtainable near. Then there was "<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Der Einlasse</span>,"
the complicated night-entrance to Augsburg,
worked by mechanism which allowed a person
to be admitted without seeing any one,—such a
mystery that many allowed themselves to be
locked out on purpose to see it work, and Queen
Elizabeth sent a special agent to acquire the
secret; in vain. But in Augsburg front doors were
habitually opened by pulleys from some room,
and shut automatically; it was at Augsburg, too,
that a coach was to be seen "driven by engines"
within it by the occupant so that it seemed to
go of itself; it had been driven about the city.<a name="Anchor-54" id="Anchor-54"></a><a href="#Footnote-54" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 54.">[54]</a>
This occurs in the year 1655; three years later
fountain pens<a name="Anchor-55" id="Anchor-55"></a><a href="#Footnote-55" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 55.">[55]</a> were on sale at Paris for ten francs
each, twelve to those whom the inventor knew to
be eager to have one; that is, £5 to £6 in our money.
Even an Italian might learn: like the Florentine
who discovered in England what garden-rollers
were, in their early solid-stone-cylinder form.
But Tasso had the chance to learn something important
and not only passed it by but places it
first among the three customs in France which he
strongly condemns. It is that in some districts
the people nourished the children with cow's milk.
How, he asks, can any good come of feeding infants
with the produce of an animal that is a beast
of burden and has to endure blows daily? An Englishman
in Italy noted the method of stripping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>hemp with wooden instruments instead of with the
fingers, the laborious English way; and fans, forks,
and umbrellas would be new to every one who
crossed the Alps; but a learned physician warned
Moryson against using the last-mentioned, "things
like a little canopy," as concentrating the heat of
the sun on the head.</p>

<p>In Flanders, again, every one might learn what
kind of a thing a door-mat was, and a Dutch barber
had only to cross the Channel to find that he
was behind the times in using dregs of beer as a
lather. And if it was possible for a twentieth-century
Englishwoman to cross into sixteenth-century
Germany she would find out what a convenience
it was for an invalid to have a towel
attached to a wheel running along the head of the
bed, to assist him or her in changing position.
Where, too, except from travel, his own or some
one else's, did Sir John Harington get his ideas
concerning the introduction of real water-closets,
with gold-fish visible swimming about in the cisterns,
just as they are to be seen at railway stations
to-day?</p>

<p>A greater discovery than all these put together
lay in the differences in the position of women in
the above countries. Take the United Provinces
and Italy, as the two where the contrast was
greatest. In the former, girls of good birth and
looks might not only settle down in the common-room
of an inn instead of hiring a private room for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>meals, but would sit round the fire and share the
after-dinner drink of the men as a matter of
course. All-night skating-parties were so common
that the liberty was not misused; whereas in Italy
the strictness was as extreme as the Dutch freedom,
and its result, too; only, in Italy, the result
was the demoralisation of both sexes. Chioggia
was an exception, where Villamont was surprised
to see the women and girls sitting at their doors,
needle-working; and where French influence had
made itself felt some relaxation had taken place,
especially at Genoa, where one foreigner even
notes that the women walked with a longer stride
than most Italian women. But the unmixed Italian
convention gave most girls no choice between
becoming either prisoners or prostitutes, that is,
of course, like everything else in this book, from
the foreigner's point of view. Of the former class
the tourist saw next to nothing; the men of the
household did even the marketing themselves;
while the latter formed one of the best-known
features of Italian life. The numbers may seem
at first sight incredible—30,000 is the figure always
quoted for Naples; but there was some
check on such statements inasmuch as every
government licensed each one for a fixed sum
and therefore could reckon the total. Moreover,
Sir Henry Wotton writes in 1592 that a census
just taken in Rome counted 40,000, and he had
it on good authority; and in 1617, that the Espousal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>of the Sea at Venice had been spoilt as a
sight because the courtesans, offended at an edict
directed at them, had abstained from taking part
in it. Those at the head of the profession lived
"like princesses," not only so far as expenditure
went, but also in their command of marks of
respect in public, except that every now and then
some sumptuary edict would create, and perhaps
enforce, some distinction between those who
populated and those who depopulated Italy. It
is pleasanter to turn back to Holland again, to
the homely arrangements of Thursday in Delft
fair week, when the women who had had enough
of waiting for husbands sat in the church and
the men who had waited long enough for wives
came to look at them. A few questions, a pot
of beer, a few details to be settled; and then the
wedding.</p>

<p>There were plenty of these fairs, Lyons had
four a year, so had Rouen; but the attraction they
possessed for the sixteenth-century human being
lay rather in the amount of wholesale and financiers
business done than in homely picturesqueness;
sentimentality is the last vice he can be
charged with. Who, for instance, nowadays, would
dare to say he saw nothing charming in a Breton
festival? but Brittany was left to itself in those
days, and a travelling doctor who chanced on one
leaves it with the remark that the Breton girls
singing their folk-songs reminded him of "the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>croaking of frogs when they are in love." Yet <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
John's Eve was a festival that gave plenty of
pleasure to lookers-on as well as those who took
part in it; at Paris, in particular, where there was
hardly a citizen named after the saint who did not
light a fire at his door that night. And it is perhaps
worth mentioning how they kept that feast
at Naples, according to Audebert, in 1577; how
the custom was to bathe in the sea previous to
paying one's devotions at "S. Giovan' a' Mare,"
seeing that he adds that the custom was dying
out, the younger people scorning it as a pagan
survival.</p>

<p>A larger proportion of the public pleasures of
Europe were bound up with religious ceremony
than is the case at present; and as regards pilgrimage,
the reference above to the subject in general
needs to be supplemented by some details concerning
the relics, since there is no room for doubt
as to whether or not they held their ground as
"sights," the more so inasmuch as a sceptical
attitude did not become a conventional habit of
mind until, to judge by tourists' books, about the
third quarter of the seventeenth century. At the
abbey of Marmoutier, near Tours, for example,
was shown a vessel which had been sent from
Heaven filled with oil for the healing of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin's
leg, a breakage of which the devil had caused
by taking away the stairs. They also showed a
vast barrel wherein <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin kept his wine; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>not till 1675 does any one remark that that was
probably the fiend who stole away the stairs.
Disbelief finds expression in plenty, it is true,
but it is always that of the Protestant who disbelieves,
not because his reason tells him the tale
must be false, but because Roman Catholicism
affirms it to be true. When there was no suspicion
of a friar at the back of the story, there
was nothing they would not swallow: even Evelyn
accepts Mettius Curtius and his chasm as if
all four evangelists had guaranteed both; or, to
take a still better example, that of the monument
near Leyden to the lady who had 365 children at
one birth—(she had laughed at a poor woman's
tale that the latter's two babies were twins, and
the woman had expressed a hope that the lady
might give birth to as many children at one confinement
as there were days in the year)—Münster,
the great Protestant geographer, repeats the
story without throwing doubt, and consequently
one tourist after another has no hesitation about
it.</p>

<p>So happy a frame of mind must have increased
the interest of many a resting-place. Breaking
one's journey at Angers, for instance, there was
a porphyry vase to be seen, one of those used at
the wedding feast at Cana in Galilee; others were
preserved at Famagosta, Magdeburg, and the
Charterhouse at Florence. At Angers, also, at
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Julian's, was a copy of the portrait of Our Lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>which <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Luke had painted; at Arras, manna which
had fallen in the days of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jerome, looking like
white wool; at Milan, the brazen serpent which
Moses set up in the wilderness; at Vienna, one
of the stones wherewith <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen had been
stoned, another at Toulouse; and at the monastery
of the Celestines at Louvain, one of the thirty
silver pennies for which Christ had been sold,
bearing the head of Tiberius on one side, a lily
on the other. It is well known how Mary Magdalen
came to Provence to live after the Crucifixion,
but less known that at Maximilien near Marseilles
the tip of her nose used to be on view: no more
than that because she had been cremated, but the
tip of her nose remained imperishable because
there Christ had kissed her. Pontius Pilate also
ended his life in Europe: in exile at Vienne, where
the tower in which he had been imprisoned was
pointed out to the visitor, likewise the lake wherein
he had committed suicide, although it was on the
shores of another lake, one in the territory of Lucerne,
that he was to be seen walking once a year
in his official robes. But this every one was content
to take on hearsay, since he who saw him
then died within the year.</p>

<p>The monastery of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas at Catania, in
Sicily, had an excellent collection: a nail from the
Cross, one of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sebastian's arrows, and pieces of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George's coat of mail, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter's beard, and
of the beard of Zachary, father of John the Baptist.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>This, and the places previously mentioned,
serve to show what treasures would surely be met
with on the road; great relic-centres like Venice
and Rome would require pages to catalogue their
wealth; even a secondary centre like Trier held
as many bodies of saints as there are days in the
year, besides the well by which Athanasius sat
when he composed the "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quicunque Vult</span>" and
the knife wherewith <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter cut off Malchus'
ear.</p>

<p>As for their belief in relics, it is only fair to
point out what may not occur to every reader,
that they had the same reason, neither more nor
less, for believing so, as we for believing that the
earth moves round the sun: it is common knowledge.
'Common knowledge'—is not all of it,
whether scientific or theological, equally an act
of faith? and is it more reasonable for us to quote
Baedeker to ourselves than for pilgrim Nicholas
to put his trust in friar John? "Howbeit (if we
will truly consider it), more worthy is it to believe,
than to know as we now know"—that is not a
quotation from a theologian but from Bacon's
"Advancement of Learning." Of two things we
may be sure, that the true history of a relic would
probably be far stranger than its legend, and that
whatever marvels the southerner saw or heard,
he came across nothing more novel or more miraculous
than the ebb and flow of the northern
tides.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>
<p>In speaking of relics, the secular ones must be
remembered, too: foremost among them the original
Ephesus statue of Diana, which Hentzner
saw at Fontainebleau and Evelyn at the
Louvre. Most frequently mentioned is the buck's
head at Amboise. It bore antlers of enormous size,
and for that reason had enjoyed Francis <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>'s
special protection while alive. By Sir John
Reresby's time (1654) it had been ascertained that
the buck was of English birth, having reached
France by swimming the Channel; while thirty-three
years later it had been dead for three hundred
years and at the date of its death was nine
hundred years old. These details need no explanation;
any caretaker can equal them under pressure.
The writer once asked the sextoness of the
church where Spinoza lies buried how he came to
be laid there considering he was not exactly orthodox:
the answer was, without hesitation, that
he became a Protestant before he died!</p>

<p>These secular relics cannot possibly be left
without a digression concerning unicorn's horns,
which were more prized than any other kind of
exhibit. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark's Treasury at Venice seems to
have been the only museum that possessed more
than one; it contained three. Dresden owned one,
which hung by a golden chain; that at Fontainebleau,
three yards high, was valued at one hundred
thousand crowns. It was, however, a wise unicorn
that knew its own horn: the Danish sailors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>kept their secrets quiet and prices high, the more
easily since, owing to disasters, there were temporary
cessations in the Greenland whale-fishery,
of which unicorns' horns were a by-product, thus
rendering the supply small and fluctuating. It was
an open secret by this time that sea-unicorns existed,
but the heraldic animal had the overwhelming
advantage of support from Pliny, Aristotle,
and the Bible and therefore fought for the
"crowns" so to speak, with every success. It was
not till this time, in 1603, that the unicorn was
introduced into the arms of the King of England;
and its horn was in the greater request because
of its supposed quality of an antidote to poison.
To the lore of this part of the subject Zinzerling
makes an addition. At Tours lived a lawyer who
had travelled in Spain and India, and had brought
back three great rarities: "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Rolandi gladium, Librum
in pergameno Geographiæ et Hydrographiæ,
membrum masculum Monocerotis majoris contra
toxica efficaciæ quam cornu</span>."</p>

<p>He did not see these personally, but mentions
them because it would be a pity for any one to
miss them for lack of a word or two from him.
For himself, he could not find the lawyer, a kind
of trouble from which these tourists ordinarily
suffered, for it was part of their experience to
make acquaintance with private collections. Not
that there were any public ones to the extent we
are accustomed to, except the churches, which, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>picture galleries, had this advantage, that the pictures
were seen in the setting for which they were
designed. Practically all the official "treasuries"
were only public to the extent that a remarkable
country house like Compton Winyates is so
now; yet on the other hand, and for that very
reason, it was somewhat more customary for
private collections to be accessible to strangers
than is the case, probably, at present. What attracted
the greatest number of visitors, however,
was water-mechanisms.</p>

<p>Up till the beginning of the seventeenth century
these were found at their best only in Italy;
and of the Italian, those at Pratolino ranked first,
belonging to the Duke of Florence, who was reputed
to spend more on his water than on his
wine. The invariable custom of secret devices
for soaking the visitor as he sat down or walked
about was there carried further, and with greater
variety, than elsewhere. Besides, there was Fame
blowing a trumpet; a peasant offering a drink to
a tiger who swallows it and then looks all round;
Syrinx beckons to Pan to pipe, whereupon Pan
gets up from his seat, puts it aside, pipes, pulls
his seat towards him and sits down again with a
melancholy look because Syrinx has not rewarded
him with a kiss. And so on, with a multitude of
devices for making music and attracting attention,
only equalled by those at the Villa d' Este
at Tivoli.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>
<p>It is noteworthy how long it took to introduce
them into France, where everything Italian was
fashionable. Marguerite de Valois speaks of those
she saw in Flanders in 1577 in a way that implies
no previous acquaintance with anything of the
kind, but when peace was restored, we find <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Germain-en-Laye stocked with a poet who plays
on a lyre, and with various animals which gather
round him, and trees which bend down, as he
plays; and the king passes by with his suite. On the
other side of the Rhine ingenuity seems to have
been devoted rather to clock-work. The clock at
Strassburg, one of the chief marvels of Europe,
was outdone by one in a private house at Augsburg:
for besides displaying all the clever puerilities
which the seventeenth century rejoiced in, it
reproduced the movements and stations of the
planets and the advent and effect of eclipses, all
in their due time. Somewhat later, at Lübeck,
the striking of the hour by the town clock was
accompanied by the Virgin kissing her Baby,
and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter dropping his key and picking it up
again, while at Hamburg could be seen a marvellous
Annunciation, with a most gorgeous Gabriel
and five attendant cherubim who flapped gilded
wings, and a Blessed Virgin dressed in the French
fashion who was discovered reading a book and
ended by dropping a curtsey.</p>

<p>Of amusements which required people to take
part in them, card games were rarely seen in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>Germany, and in Italy were banned as much by
public opinion as by law, whereas in England
they were an occupation rather than an amusement.
So also with hawking and hunting. In six
years abroad Moryson saw hawking but twice,
once in Bohemia and once in Poland, and implies
that in England it was common; while of hunting
he definitely says, "England lacks not Actæons,
eaten up by their own dogs." The same contrast
he observes with regard to itinerant musicians
and plays, of which latter he is sure that more are
performed in London than in all the other parts
of the world that he had visited put together. A
variety of angling, on the other hand, he notes
as peculiar to Italy: that with bait and hooks
fastened to corks and held out of window for
birds; while golf was only played in Scotland,
Holland, and Naples; and the most frequently
played game in Europe, pallone, was as unknown
in Britain then as now. The piazza S. Stefano at
Venice was reserved for pallone every Sunday evening,
and in the disused papal palace at Avignon
one room was given up to pallone and another to
tennis, which came next in popularity, the chief
centre being Paris. In 1577 it was credited with
1800 courts, but the Dutch ambassador resident
there eighty years later had them counted and
only discovered 118.</p>

<p>And so the list might go on and on and on—in
all its seeming irrelevancy! And yet, when it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>borne in mind that every detail is one that some
tourist or other noticed, to the point of thinking it
worth recording, a certain, at least symbolic, relevancy
comes into view, even though it be nothing
more vital than that of a 16th-century variety of
subjective imbecility under the stimulus of a jog-trot.
On the other hand, all this comes under the
heading of</p>

<p>Andrew Boorde has something to say about
Iceland in his guide to Europe. He puts into the
mouth of a native the words,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
     <div class="verse">"I am an Icelander, as brute as a beast,</div>
     <div class="verse">When I eat candle ends, I am at a feast."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And that is all they knew about Iceland. As a
country with a political history and a literature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>it was no more present in their minds than as a
holiday resort. Nor were any of the countries
that bordered the Baltic, except on the South.
But Danzig alone was enough to keep the Baltic
a busy sea, and consequently Denmark was
not as much ignored as would otherwise have
happened; for both sides of the entrance to the
Baltic belonged to the King of Denmark, whose
extortions in the way of tolls kept his name before
the public.</p>

<p>Norway was thus practically isolated from Europe.
Sweden, however, during the Thirty Years'
War, attracted some attention, partly on account
of its share in the war, partly on account of the
development of its silver mines. There is an interesting
account of a visit to those at "Sylfbergen,"
twenty leagues from Stockholm, in 1667,
which may serve as an indication of experiences
that might have been met with at an earlier date.
The visitor, a Frenchman,<a name="Anchor-57" id="Anchor-57"></a><a href="#Footnote-57" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 57.">[57]</a> descended, half-naked,
in half a cask, which was attached to a cable by
three iron chains, accompanied by two workers
whose grimness, flavour, and unpleasant personalities,
gave him an attack of nerves. Among
the miners he found French, Germans, English,
Italians and Russians, all, as he says, digging their
own graves, for the conditions of mining in those
days was terrible. A traveller through Hungary
in 1615<a name="Anchor-58" id="Anchor-58"></a><a href="#Footnote-58" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 58.">[58]</a> notes that the miners there could not
work more than four hours at a stretch, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>few reached middle age, what with the number
of casualties and the conditions of the mines.
One result of this was that they usually married
at fifteen. Yet weekly wages, after making allowance
for the cheapness of living in Hungary, were
equivalent to no more than twelve to fourteen
shillings at present values. It was a most natural
question at the time to ask whether, working as
they did in the bowels of the earth, they ever
came across demons. To which question a miner
answered that sometimes they did, and on those
occasions they appeared in the shape of little
black boys, chattering, but doing no harm beyond
blowing the lamps out.</p>

<p>Returning northwards and continuing the journey
to the other side of the Baltic, the dominions
of the Grand Duke of Muscovy would not be
reached immediately. Riga, the port most usually
aimed at, belonged to Poland; the alternative
harbour of Revel to Sweden. The choice of
Riga is another instance of the contemporary
preference for travelling by water rather than by
land. However far out of the straight line between
Danzig and Moscow, it was both the nearest coast
town to the latter and also at the mouth of the
river, the Dwina, which is navigable for the longest
distance west of Moscow. One other route remains,
discovered by the English, left wholly to
them and to the Dutch, and only used by them
because of commercial quarrels with the rulers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>the Baltic. This was the sea-voyage of about
two months from London to Archangel, then up
the Dwina and Suchona to Vologda, and thence
by land to Moscow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 531px;"><a id="i_b_156fp"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_156fp.jpg" width="531" height="400" alt="DANGERS OF THE NORTHERN SEAS" />
<div class="caption">DANGERS OF THE NORTHERN SEAS</div>
</div>

<p>Moscow then possessed about forty thousand
houses. It may be doubted if any town in Europe
surpassed that number. Yet it was not size that
caused going to Muscovy to be practically identical
with going to Moscow, but the fact that the
latter was the residence of a ruler whose despotism
was so unlimited that every other settlement
became insignificant compared with that where
he dwelt. This is typified by the prominence
given by all foreigners to the banquet they generally
attended as the guests of the Tsar, a display
of barbaric magnificence that must evidently
have been one of the most striking sights of Europe.
Unfortunately the magnificence was apt
to stop short at the door of the banquet-hall.
One Italian<a name="Anchor-59" id="Anchor-59"></a><a href="#Footnote-59" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 59.">[59]</a> in particular could not forget leaving
after three hours, picking his way through the
outer rooms, pitch dark and strewn with courtiers
in the weeping-stage of drunkenness, down the
stairs. About twenty yards away from the foot
of the stairs a crowd of servants were waiting
with horses to take their masters home. Towards
these they had to wade, knee-deep in mud, still
in pitch-darkness, and so continue a good part
of the way home, since no one was allowed to
ride till he had passed out of the palace precincts.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>
<p>Nowhere was this despotism more felt than in
relation to travel: every foreigner was half a
prisoner from the day he entered the kingdom
to the day he left, even though he were an ambassador.
The very Jesuits sent by the Pope, in
1581, at the Tsar's own request, to negotiate a
peace between himself and the King of Poland
were under surveillance to such an extent that
they were not allowed to water their own horses.
Neither was any subject allowed to leave the land:
the penalty for unlicensed travel being death.
It is clear that leave must have been more freely
granted than one might imagine from the general
statements of visitors, since Russian pilgrims and
merchants are by no means uncommon, and indeed,
at this period, Peter Mogila, Metropolitan
of Kiev, and Boris Godunov, ruler at Moscow,
endeavoured to encourage travel by Russians as a
means of education.</p>

<p>Godunov's efforts, in fact, beginning as they did
with his accession in 1586, synchronised with the
growth of the same idea in England. But his
efforts failed through being too far ahead of public
opinion; those whom he sent stayed away permanently,
those who stayed at home remained unconverted.<a name="Anchor-60" id="Anchor-60"></a><a href="#Footnote-60" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 60.">[60]</a>
Two instances of public opinion as
regards foreigners may be quoted, both occurring
on the direct road to Moscow at the very end of
this period, during the whole of which the number
of visitors goes on increasing. The first is the experience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>of some Dutchmen who came by invitation
of the Tsar and consequently had a house
commandeered for them. The wife of the owner,
seeing no help was to be had from the local authorities,
rushed to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas and would, she believed,
have obtained a miraculous expulsion of
the visitors had not her husband tired of the length
of her prayer and stopped it by force. The second
is that of a Danish gentleman who, with his companions,
was prevented from entering a village
by bees which the peasants had irritated for that
purpose.</p>

<p>So, too, with the Muscovites and travel on
their own account. Whereas other Europeans
only thought of dying when they travelled, the
Muscovite only thought of travelling when he
died. Then his friends shod him with a new pair
of shoes for the long journey that he had to go,
and put a letter in his hand to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas, by
way of passport, testifying that the bearer died
a Russian of the Russians in the one true faith.</p>

<p>The distinctive characteristics of the people
as seen by strangers were drunkenness, endurance
of heat, cold, and torture, and slavish obedience
to the Tsar. Drunkenness in particular. As the
English verse-writer, Turberville, who went there,
puts it,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
     <div class="verse">Drink is their whole desire, the pot is all their pride,</div>
     <div class="verse">The soberest head doth once a day stand needful of a guide.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>
<p>The habit went the farther since it was encouraged
by the government, for the recent taking-over
of the drink-traffic by the State was but a reversion
to the state of affairs in 1600, though then it
was an offence against the State to urge a man to
leave one of the State-owned taverns, even though
he was pledging the clothes off his back: a common
custom. At every season of public rejoicing
in winter two or three hundred died in the streets
of Moscow as they lay there naked and dead-drunk,
and the stranger might see the bodies
brought home by tens and twelves, half-eaten by
dogs. One traveller tells a tale of a Muscovite
whom he saw come out of a tavern in shirt and
breeches only, meet a friend, return, and come out
again with no shirt. The traveller, who knew
Russian, expressed sympathy with him as if he
had been robbed, but was answered, "No, it's the
man at the bar and his wine that have brought
me to this, but as my shirt's there my breeches
may as well keep it company." And accordingly,
a few minutes afterwards, he came out once more
with nothing to cover him but a handful of flowers
picked at the tavern-door!</p>

<p>There had been a Tsar who tried to repress
drunkenness, but he became a dead failure in
every sense of the phrase shortly before the above
incident happened, and even during his lifetime
achieved nothing more than preventing people
going about the streets naked. Neither was it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>just the average man who could not endure life
sober, but the priest frequently needed a lay-helper
on either side of him in order to get through
the marriage service, a result of the festivities
preceding the wedding. And the women were no
better than the men. When a Russian lady entertained
her friends, it was etiquette to send round
afterwards to know if they all got home safely.
Yet one traveller unconsciously gives the Muscovite's
own point of view: there was a quarter of
Moscow known as the "drunken" quarter: that
was where the foreign soldiers lodged.</p>

<p>The excessive misuse of tobacco was also bound
to be noticed, considering that smoking became
general more quickly there than anywhere else
outside England and Turkey. But the Tsar who
failed to check drunkenness succeeded against
smoking, which he prohibited, under penalty of
slitting the nostrils, in 1634, on the ground of it
being a frequent cause of fires among the houses,
all wooden ones, and of the unholy state of the
Muscovite's breath when he addressed the saints.</p>

<p>Along with other accusations which the travellers
have to lodge, such as that of a grossness of
indecency without parallel in their experience,
is hardly to be found one note of pleasure, except
with regard to the charm of the Russian spring.
It may be doubted if foreigners' opinions underwent
much change until such writers as Turgenev
compelled attention to the point of creating sympathy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>But yet, if their tales be few and their
enjoyment scanty, their records possess all the
greater comparative value from the very fact
of their fewness. That the pre-Christian Slav religion
still remained in memory, if not in use, at
Pskov as late as 1590 would probably never even
have been guessed but for the remark of one Johann
David Wunderer, who was there at that
date, that he saw two stone statues there, one
holding a cross, the other standing on a snake with
a sword in one hand and fire in the other, idols, he
was told, who were still known as "Ussladt" and
"Corsa."<a name="Anchor-61" id="Anchor-61"></a><a href="#Footnote-61" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 61.">[61]</a></p>

<p>It will have been noticed that the tourist was
nothing if not unsympathetic. Yet nowhere
does this stand out so sharply as in regard to
the two countries farthest west. So far as the
Spanish peninsula was concerned, a reason may
be sought in the route usually chosen, a route
which treated the peninsula as part of "European
Europe" and implied seeing a little of it,
seeing that little in a one-sided way, and mistaking
it for an epitome of the whole.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<p>Starting from the southwest corner of France,
the most direct way was taken for the Escorial
and Madrid, whence the return journey led past
Barcelona to Montserrat and so over the Pyrenees
again to the southeast corner of France. The
objective, of course, was the capital and the court.
And it was taken for granted, here as elsewhere,
that the other chief objects of interest were the
towns, which claimed an even greater proportion
of attention than in other countries, inasmuch as
the hardships of travel in Spain were more trying
to a foreigner than those experienced elsewhere,
and his mental energies were often, in consequence,
the less free for observation in Spain as
long as he kept on the move. Now it unfortunately
happened that the seamy side of Spanish life
thrust itself to the front in undue proportion in
the towns. Moreover, the French districts which
lay nearest to Spain were those whose characteristics
contrasted most favourably as against those
of the Spanish districts that lay nearest to France.
The liveliness and gaiety of the Bayonnais, playing
bowls all day on the carefully levelled, sanded
court between his house and the street, was
thrown into relief by the sternness of the Pyrenees
and the poverty and gloom of the Vizcaino.</p>

<p>The injustice done by these first impressions
was deepened by almost all that caught the
attention on a journey like that just outlined,
whatever the momentary point of view, whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>historical, geographical, social, superficial, or political,—especially
political.</p>

<p>The Spanish king was looked on as the most
powerful Christian monarch of the time, in prestige,
in financial resources, and as the head of an
empire whose limits were the more impressive for
being mathematicians' lines imagined in the midst
of the Unexplored. It was natural, then, to consider
his capital the centre of each, as well as of
all, of his dominions, and as the Holy of Holies
of European kingship; and this, too, at a date
when monarchical ideals were so strong that a
highly respectable middle-class man like William
Camden could allude to Simon de Montfort, who
figures in modern school-books as the ever-glorious
founder of "representative" government, as—"our
Catiline."<a name="Anchor-62" id="Anchor-62"></a><a href="#Footnote-62" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 62.">[62]</a> In addition, the annexation
of Portugal in 1580, and its revolt in 1640, accentuate
such ideas more in this period than in any
other as the only one during which the whole
peninsula was under one king.</p>

<p>Neither was this illusion of solidarity merely
a traveller's mirage which those on the spot would
rectify. Philip <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>'s people loved to have it so;
witness one of Sancho Panza's favourite proverbs:
"Un rey, Una fe, Una ley"; and how was the tourist
to know that the Spaniard did not appreciate
his differentiation between ideals and facts? The
voice of Sancho Panza is, of course, the voice of
Castile, but then Castile has always the monopoly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>of forming foreign, and leading Spanish,
opinion on things Spanish.</p>

</div>

<p>The choice of route, then, predetermined by
the usual considerations, applicable only to other
countries, failed to do justice to Spain. Yet it
was accompanied by these special assumptions, as
regards political supremacy, at the back of the
tourist's mind, no evidence in favour of which
was forthcoming; at least, no evidence of a kind
which he came prepared to recognise as such. On
the contrary, he could not avoid being struck by
the insignificance of Spanish buildings, especially,
curiously enough, at Madrid itself, where the
houses were mostly of one story; a result of it
being necessary to obtain a license from the King
for anything higher, the conditions imposed by
which license, such as that of housing ambassadors
in the second story, would prove too burdensome.
This particular impression was deepened
in the latter half of the period by the linen window-panes,
which made the interiors seem gloomy at
a date when the use of glass in windows was
spreading in the countries which the visitor had
come from and had passed through. And so with
many other matters, until one Dutchman who
had travelled viâ Italy, after being taken to see
a water-mill as something quite out of the common,
makes the general deduction: "What is
very common elsewhere, here often passes for
miraculous."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>
<p>Furthermore, as has been said, there were the
historical illusions, too, which would be shaken.
What Montaigne experienced at Venice took
place on a larger scale in the minds of all who
visited Spain. The deeper the previous study,
the deeper the disappointment; but the latter
was felt nevertheless by him in whom it was unconscious;
and in both cases the recovery was
slower than at Venice where all that was visible
was so near. In fact, it is clear enough that with
most a recovery never happened.</p>

<p>The histories they depended on were a variety
of heroic fiction whose theory of causation consisted
of immediate causes and God. National
limitations only appeared, therefore, in so far as
they had contributed to national achievements.
But to the tourist these limitations, and even the
qualities which were simply strange to him, stood
out as defects, and the necessary minutiæ of daily
life as the unworthy preoccupations of degenerate
descendants; while the people, accordingly, whose
ancestors were represented as having done nothing
but conquer for centuries, showed up as ordinary
human beings, muddling along in the way customary
among one's own countrymen. Yet successes
of Spanish diplomacy were so recent, and
the supremacy of Spanish infantry so terribly
obvious, that strangers could not account for all
this disillusion by assuming degeneration to be
the sole reason; while it was likewise too sudden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>for them to see in it nothing but an example of
the falsification of proportions inherent in all
knowledge drawn from books or other second-hand
sources. Their attitude to Spain when they revised
their journals was thus mystification rather
than contempt or disgust, though both the latter
are usually present.</p>

<p>This same unpreparedness to take a totally
fresh point of view is even more marked in relation
to religion. However greatly at odds the
matter-of-fact foreigner and the matter-of-faith
Castilian might be over details, both were equally
unwilling to accept the illusions of to-morrow on
that subject in place of the illusions of yesterday.
The tendency to accept the face values of things
theological was then as strong as to-day it is weak;
but, with the possible exception of seventeenth-century
Ireland, it was nowhere so strong as in
Spain. The latter's place in Europe was bound up
with leadership of the cause of Roman Catholicism;
foreigners took this for granted, and the
Spaniards unconsciously set a value on their
creed apart from its relation to theological logic
or religious experience—it had so long been the
only rallying cry which could bring about a sinking
of differences and achieve the temporary unity
which was essential to success in war. But to
the contemporary stranger, the varnish of the
water of baptism was opaque, and the Celt, the
Moor, the Pre-historic, the Outrageous-Pagan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>and the all-pervading Jew, seemed all one thing,
ultra-Holy-Roman. Another source of mystification—except
to the Protestant, who knew
exactly what it all meant and so went further
astray than the rest, in the same direction.</p>

<p>Socially, the unintelligible contradictoriness
was as great. Witness one whom a Burgos gentleman
invited to dinner. The dining-room was that
in which the hostess lay ill in bed with a fever;
and he remembered afterwards that he had behaved
with grossly bad manners inasmuch as he
had taken off his hat at meal-time.</p>

<p>To go on to the means whereby geography also
contributed to strain the sixteenth-century tourist's
easily ruptured sympathy, there was the
climate. The majority started in fear of the heat
and suffered only from cold, expecting to find an
Andalusian spring perpetually reigning at, say
Burgos, instead of its "ten months of winter and
two of hell" (or, to retain the pun, "<span xml:lang="es" lang="es">diez mezes
de invierno y dos de infierno</span>"); whereas the visit
to the South which was so rarely paid would
have restored beliefs which had foundation enough.
Besides, through this fear of the heat they traversed
what they did traverse at the seasons
when what fascination it possessed was least in
evidence.</p>

<p>Among other conditions, the economic seem
to have scandalised observers most. Perhaps the
student will have noticed that whatever year during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>the last three hundred he may chance to be
reading about in the history of Spain, the country
will always at that moment have reached the
last stage of economic exhaustion. Another quarter
of a century or so, and, curiously enough, a
lower stage will have been reached; yet another
twenty-five years and one still lower; and so on
until one would think the most hypothetical zero
of bankruptcy must belong to a happier past and
the population can consist of no more than a few
emaciated grandees licking the rocks for sustenance.
The natural attempt will be to go farther
and farther back to trace the steps of the decline;
and in time one will come upon these whose accounts
are under consideration; but it will be without
satisfaction. There is nothing for it but to go
right back to the golden age. But in Guicciardini
(1513) there is just the same tale, scarcity of inhabitants;
poverty; mean aspects of daily life;
stagnation in commerce owing entirely to Spanish
aversion from work; industries under foreign control.
It suggests that possibly the same phenomena
have been in existence early and late, and
that what earlier writers describe as an undeveloped
country is the same as the "exhausted"
one of later days; the difference, if this is the
case, lying not in the conditions seen but in the
extent of the stranger's expectations, moderate
when the power of Spain had just become of international
account; too high, later, when it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>assumed that political power of long standing
could not have grown up except in association
with economic strength of equal greatness. To
travellers of this period any unsoundness or "exhaustion"
seemed the more incomprehensible in
that Spain was by far the chief importer of bullion,
the universal value of which they were accustomed
to overrate.</p>

<p>Guicciardini, however, says nothing about the
misbehaviour of Spanish women by which the
next three or four generations of travellers are invariably
shocked, with one exception, that of
Lady Fanshawe, who saw much to admire in
them and nothing to condemn, and had she seen
what the men saw there is no doubt whatever her
scorn would have been very pronounced. According
to the men, neither the Italian fashion of
the men restraining the women, nor the transalpine
fashion of the women restraining themselves,
was used in Spain. But it must be remembered
that the male tourist tends to see the womenfolk
of the country he visits nearer their worst
than their best.</p>

<p>Too warm a welcome was not a fault into which
the males fell. In Madrid a Protestant might
feel safe, and in centres of international trade,
such as Medina del Campo, free from insult; at
Burgos there was even courtesy, and at Barcelona
civility, although it went hand in hand with
robbery. But for the most part, it was needful to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>both callous and plucky. In particular, the traveller
must take care to get his hair cut short at
Vittoria at the latest. French and many Germans
as well as English wore their hair long, and nothing
laid them open to insult, and even injury, so
much as that; if they were clean-shaven as well,
it was taken as certain that they carried effeminacy
to extremes; neither were they the last to
hear of it. "Rogue" and "thief" were ordinary
terms, even after a hair-cut, and when the queen
was a German, one of her countrymen, a man
who could be trusted not to give offence, had to
buy a new hat at Toledo because the one he was
wearing bore too many traces of cow-dung; at
Seville he was stoned.</p>

<p>Yet considering the average elsewhere, the
individual Spaniard stood to gain by comparison;
one of the most prejudiced and illiterate of the
tourists admits being treated with great courtesy,
and there is a general agreement that the standard
of honesty was remarkably high. It is amusing,
too, to notice what disconcerting answers
were sometimes received by the gentlemen from
abroad who thought that the peasantry of a Roman
Catholic and poverty-stricken country only
needed to be questioned in order that the pitiable
state of their mind should become apparent, even
to themselves.</p>

<p>To one question, why extreme severity should
be reserved for heretics, the reply was that heresy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>was the only crime which had not the excuse of
giving pleasure; while another who was asked why
a saint's day should be honoured so highly and
Sunday practically ignored, pointed out that the
saint's day came but once a year and Sunday
every week. So, too, it came as a surprise to the
Protestant to find Spanish nuns neither neurotic,
depressed, nor prim, but bright and attractive,
and their education "infinitely beyond all our
English schools."<a name="Anchor-63" id="Anchor-63"></a><a href="#Footnote-63" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 63.">[63]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, what with the above experiences,
together with others which will be more in place
farther on, it is not surprising if Spain was considered
a country of especial danger and difficulties,
where there was nothing to be learnt that
had not better remain unlearnt, nor anything
worth seeing.</p>

<p>The best guide, in answering this last objection,
urges that the court at Madrid and the church of
San Lorenzo at the Escorial are alone worth the
journey, and names fifty-eight towns to complete
the answer. It would be superfluous to enter into
details; it is more difficult for us to doubt it than
for them to believe it. But Seville must not be
passed over altogether, the Seville of Cervantes'
"<span xml:lang="es" lang="es">Novelas Ejemplares</span>," the Seville which was
what Madrid pretended to be, the Spanish capital
of Spanish Spain. Half the buildings that the
modern visitor goes to see there were new in 1600,
but the great sight, as great a sight as any in Europe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>both in itself and for its associations, was the
arrival of the silver fleet from the "Indies."</p>

<p>Of the two chief places of pilgrimage, Montserrat,
being on a main road from France and
not far from Barcelona, is very frequently mentioned,
but an account of a journey to Compostella
is far rarer. Concerning the former, one
account contains a particular of which there is perhaps
no other record. The occupant of the highest
of the almost inaccessible hermitages around the
monastery, that of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jerome, in 1599, could bring
the wild birds flocking round him when he called
them, in such numbers that the writer, who had
been throughout the peninsula, mentions the sight
as the most wonderful in all Spain. Two ravens
lived with the hermit in his cell.<a name="Anchor-64" id="Anchor-64"></a><a href="#Footnote-64" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 64.">[64]</a> As for Compostella,
Andrew Boorde tells how he met nine men
leaving Orleans on the way thither, and how he
tried to dissuade them, saying he would rather
go from England to Rome five times than once
to Compostella, and that the government might
well set in the stocks persons who proposed going
thither without special leave, as being a waste of
valuable lives. They persisted, and he accompanied
them. Not one of the ten survived the journey
except himself; and he was a doctor. Only one account
preserves much detail of a stay at Compostella,
that of a German soldier,<a name="Anchor-65" id="Anchor-65"></a><a href="#Footnote-65" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 65.">[65]</a> in 1581, who
confessed to an Italian priest, nicknamed Linguarius
for knowing Italian, Spanish, French, German,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>Latin and other languages; and saw all that a
good pilgrim should see, including the two great
bells whose sound was so terrific as to frighten
lady pilgrims into miscarriages. At Santo Domingo
de la Calzada on the road, according to a
Pole,<a name="Anchor-66" id="Anchor-66"></a><a href="#Footnote-66" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 66.">[66]</a> there remained a curious survival of divination
by birds. In the church porch white capons
were reared in a copper-wire cage, to which the
pilgrim used to offer bread on the end of his staff;
if the bird refused the bread, it was held an omen
that the pilgrim would die on the journey.</p>

<p>Among the other things that Spain had in common
with "European Europe" may be mentioned
the royal Zoos: one at Madrid, where a crocodile
was to be seen, also the first rhinoceros that had
been brought to Europe; the other at Valladolid,
containing four lions, an eagle, four seals, and canary-birds.
In water-works Aranjuez could hold
its own against Italy, with its brazen statue of
Priapus, casting forth water from every extremity,
a cave with two dragons and many birds, the
birds being made to sing by the movements of
the water; with satyrs and savages, and artificial
cypresses and white roses which soaked the visitor
who touched them. Neither were the horribles
kept out of sight: at Seville some one speaks of
seeing a thief shot to death with arrows, and two
other criminals beheaded with swords, the bodies
being laid up against a church-wall to attract alms
to pay for their burial.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>
<p>The coupling of Ireland with Spain does not
result from the mere chance of westernmost position,
nor even from the political needs that they
shared, or from the supposed kinship of the peoples.
While other countries aroused curiosity and then
gratified it, these two occasioned, successively,
illusion, disillusion, mystification. Which often
led to abuse, but not so often, as regards Ireland,
by Englishmen, as is represented by experienced
controversialists who well know the effect of sixteenth-century
phrases torn from their context
and set up on a background of journalese, where
the flavour of the original spelling fixes their seeming
harshness in the memory of those controversialists
cater for.</p>

<p>There can be no more effective counterblast
to this than a study of the books of the time
recording journeys from everywhere to everywhere,
for from these it will be evident that what
the Englishmen say of Ireland and the Irish is
more favourable than what contemporary foreigners
usually say of the countries and nations
that they visit; and also that where the English
are unfavourable they are borne out by other
foreigners. All adverse comment may be included
under the charge of barbarism. Now Captain
Cuellar, as unprejudiced a witness as could be
required, being a Spaniard wrecked there from
the Armada and a man who took everything as
it came, invariably speaks of each Irishman as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>"el selvaje," which cannot be translated as anything
but "the savage."</p>

<p>But here lies the fact which supplies the contrast
between Spaniards and Irish, a contrast
within the similarity which classed the two together,
as countries seen by foreigners. The latter's
disillusion was produced by the barbarism
interwoven with the civilisation of Spain, but,
in Ireland, by the civilisation co-existent with the
known barbarism. It was a perpetual surprise to
all visitors to find many of the individuals of a
society that persisted in the crudest and rudest
way of living, showing a force of intelligence and
character, and in certain ways a refinement and
a degree of education, which seemed to presuppose
all the advantages that the best of European
surroundings and training had to give.</p>

<p>Most are content just to note these and other
contrasts; the sum of their opinion as regarded the
people being: "If they be bad you shall nowhere
meet with worse; if they be good you shall hardly
find better."<a name="Anchor-67" id="Anchor-67"></a><a href="#Footnote-67" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 67.">[67]</a> Of experience of this, Captain
Cuellar's narrative stands out as a quintessential
example. It is equally handy for those who
wish to prove the Irish the most charming, or the
most abominable, nation that ever existed. He
found them equally ready to strip him and to feed
him, to wound and to heal, to betray and to
shelter, to make him at home and to make him
work. Compare with this the conclusions of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>impartial Italian<a name="Anchor-68" id="Anchor-68"></a><a href="#Footnote-68" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 68.">[68]</a> seventy years earlier. The
women he found very beautiful and white, but
dirty; the people generally, very religious, yet
do not consider stealing a sin. He was given to
understand that Irish people looked down on such
as were averse to share and share alike as regards
the blessings of fortune, and certainly came across
many on the road anxious to give effect to communistic
theories; these he terms robbers.</p>

<p>Aliens of a philosophic turn of mind, after passing
through the state of surprise, not so much,
even, at their being this or that, as at their being
content or able to continue to be both at once,
turned to looking for reasons. The foreigner who
brought to bear on this question as great an amount
of knowledge, experience, and fair-mindedness as
any was Sir John Davies, who, in his "Discovery,"
after referring to the Irishman's "contempt
and scorn of all things necessary for the civil life
of man," goes on, "for though the Irishry be a
nation of great antiquity and wanted neither art
nor valour and ... were lovers of music and poetry,
and all kinds of learning, and possessed a land
abounding with all things necessary; yet ... I
dare say boldly that never any person did build
any stone or brick house for his private habitation,
but such as have lately obtained estates according
to the course of the law of England. Neither
did any of them in all this time plant any gardens
or orchards, enclose or improve their lands, live
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>together in settled villages or towns, nor make any
provision for posterity; which being against all
common sense and reason, must needs be imputed
to those unreasonable customs which made their
estates so uncertain and transitory in their possessions."</p>

<p>If Sir John Davies thought thus, it is not surprising
that hastier foreigners who had less knowledge
of the ancient Irish civilisation, thought so
too. We have just seen how, with regard to Spain,
a history made up of the imaginary glories of an
imaginary past helped to give the foreigner so
high an idea of the individuals of the nation that
the reality came as a shock. Here in Ireland, in
this matter as in others, was a similarity with a
difference. However true it may be that the Irish
suffered from a radical lack of adaptability to
modern conditions, the defects of it were undoubtedly
heightened in the eyes of strangers by the
latter's ignorance of the conditions that the Irish
could accept, the Brehon laws, for instance, and
all that they imply, especially the check on their
misuse by means of public opinion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="i_b_178fp"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_178fp.jpg" width="600" height="340" alt="AN IRISH DINNER" />
<div class="caption">AN IRISH DINNER</div>
</div>

<p>Two features, however, were almost invariably
commended: Irish harping and Irish girls. And
the latter were at no disadvantage among the
foreigners, since even in the far west which Captain
Cuellar visited, they spoke Latin fluently,
although content with one garment, often with
less. The only fault that could be found with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>them was that of growing older as years went on,
for to see an old Irishwoman before breakfast was,
says Moryson, enough to turn a man's stomach.
The country, too, received unlimited praise, with
one abatement here also: in respect of its wetness;
greater then than now, it may be said with some
certainty.<a name="Anchor-69" id="Anchor-69"></a><a href="#Footnote-69" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 69.">[69]</a> Lithgow, in particular, when he visited
"this sequestrate and most auspicuous monarchy,"
in 1619, discovered there "more Rivers, Lakes,
Brooks, Strands, Quagmires, Bogs, and Marshes
than in all Christendom besides." In five months
he ruined six horses and was himself more tired
than any of them.</p>

<p>Great, however, were the fetiches, and they
prevailed. The essentials of life, as they appeared
to the Irishman, and as they appeared to most
Europeans, differed so utterly, and the reasons
underlying the differences were so unrealisable
to each other, that Ireland remained comparatively
unvisited on account of its lack of the kind
of interest for which travellers felt themselves
bound to look. So, at least, the balance of the
evidence seems to show, but the evidence is as
conflicting here as in relation to everything else
to do with Ireland. While the Bollandist fathers
affirm that fifteen hundred foreigners made the
pilgrimage to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick's Purgatory during the
"Counter-Reformation,"<a name="Anchor-70" id="Anchor-70"></a><a href="#Footnote-70" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 70.">[70]</a> the native contemporary
Catholic, Phillip O'Sullivan, living at Madrid,
had to go back beyond the memory of living man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>for the written account of such a pilgrimage with
which he wished to preface his history of the
struggle against England. Or again, the excellent
knowledge the Irish leaders in this struggle received
of foreign affairs presupposes a great deal
of going to and fro; yet De Thou, in a letter dated
1605,<a name="Anchor-71" id="Anchor-71"></a><a href="#Footnote-71" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 71.">[71]</a> by which date he had been working at
his history of his own times for many years and
was well known as a man worth helping to correspondents
all over Europe, writes that he has not
hitherto come across any one who has personal
knowledge of Ireland nor even any one who has
talked with some one who has been there.</p>

<p>Neither are there nearly so many casual references
to visitors as one chances on with regard
to other countries. Two exceptions which suggest
the likelihood of others are, however, to be
found mentioned in the correspondence between
the English Privy Council and the Deputy at
Dublin.<a name="Anchor-72" id="Anchor-72"></a><a href="#Footnote-72" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 72.">[72]</a> In 1572 the latter announces the arrival
of three German earls with one Mr. Rogers,
their guide, adding, to Lord Burghley, "according
to your directions, they shall travel as little
way into the country as I can manage." This is
explained by the second reference, seven years
later, when three more Germans come across with
letters of introduction from the Privy Council,
who half suspect them, young though they are, of
being spies. But after the close of this period, in
1666, we find a Frenchman<a name="Anchor-73" id="Anchor-73"></a><a href="#Footnote-73" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 73.">[73]</a> noting that the Provost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>of Trinity College "seemed astonished that
out of mere curiosity I should come to see Ireland,
which is a country so retired and almost unknown
to foreign travellers."</p>

<h3>PART <abbr title="1">I</abbr><br />

<small>THE GRAND SIGNOR</small></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He who would behold these Times in their greatest glory, could
not find a better scene than Turkey."</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Sir Henry Blount</span>, 1635.</p></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">From</span> an historical point of view, a continent
consists not only of land but also of
the seas from which attacks on the land
can be made at short notice. For this reason Mohammedan
Europe used to be far wider in extent
than the Turkish territory, although the latter,
indeed, bordered the Adriatic and stopped but a
few miles short of Vienna. The Mediterranean
was under Mohammedan, rather than Christian,
control. Independent, too, in varying degrees, as
were the rulers of North Africa, a bond of union
existed among them owing to the peoples of the
opposite coasts professing a creed different from
theirs; a bond which was not interfered with by
jealousies, inasmuch as the Sultan, or as he was
usually termed then, the "Grand Signor" (or
the "Grand Turk"), was so infinitely superior that
there was never any question as to who should
take the lead. His fleet, in fact, resembled that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>of Queen Elizabeth, being made up of crews who
pursued the same course of life in peace and in
war—that of attacking wherever attacks seem
likely to pay—with no more difference than this,
that their behaviour was official in the second case
and unofficial in the first. These corsairs, then,
were all part of Mohammedan Europe, carrying
out the foreign policy of the "Grand Signor"
whether they had been previously adopted or
were subsequently to be disowned.</p>

<p>For the tourist, it has already become evident
that he was almost certain to be confronted with
the subjects, or the agents, of the Ottoman Empire,
sooner or later; and then was to be made
aware that, if one of the two existed on sufferance,
that one was himself. Here is the beginning of
a prayer introduced into the English liturgy in
1565;<a name="Anchor-74" id="Anchor-74"></a><a href="#Footnote-74" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 74.">[74]</a>—"O Almighty and Everlasting God, our
Heavenly Father, we thy disobedient and rebellious
children, now by thy just judgment sore
afflicted, and in great danger to be oppressed,
by thine and our sworn and most deadly enemies,
the Turks...." Historians agree that it was in
the third quarter of the sixteenth century that the
Turks' power reached its height. Rarely, later
than that, are they mentioned otherwise than incidentally
in the books from which modern Christendom
draws its information, and their earlier
appearances are rather on account of sensational
events and minor indirect influence than as one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>of the Powers of Europe. Yet throughout this
period, that is, for three-quarters of a century
after decline, according to historians, had begun,
the Turks were not only one of the Powers, but
the chief one, equal with any in diplomacy, superior
to any by land and by sea.</p>

<p>At a date when our text-books represent England
as wresting the supremacy on the water from
Spain, contemporary opinion regarded Turkey
as the first naval power. The chief of the sensational
events just referred to, the battle of Lepanto,
is made to stand out, as that of Agincourt
in English history, not because it typifies the
course of events, but because it is a bright spot
for the Christian pupil's eye to rest on. Within
one year afterwards the Turks were ready to meet
the Christians again: within two years they had
the biggest fleet in the world: within three the
Venetians agreed to pay 300,000 ducats (worth
now about £500,000) as indemnity; and the fifth
year afterwards the Venetian Lippomano takes it
for granted, in speaking before the Signory—in
other words, a man representing the pick of the
diplomatists of the day speaking, after full consideration,
to the most critical of audiences—that
without the joint help of the Muscovites
and Poles Christendom can never hope really to
get the upper hand of the Turks.<a name="Anchor-75" id="Anchor-75"></a><a href="#Footnote-75" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 75.">[75]</a></p>

<p>It must be remembered, too, that the Atlantic
then was what the Pacific is now, the ocean of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>future; "command of the sea" meant, to the
average sixteenth-century man, command of the
Mediterranean, from the basin of which had risen
all the civilisations of which he had any knowledge,
through which lay the most used trade-route,
and round which lay the biggest cities known to
him: Cairo, Constantinople, Aleppo, and Fez (all
Mohammedan).</p>

<p>But when this period of their supposed decline
had set in, the Mohammedans, for the first time,
ceased to be content with the Mediterranean
and began to practise—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>as Marlowe phrases it on behalf of Tamburlane.
In 1616 Sir G. Carew writes to Sir T. Roe that
the Turks are passing out of the Mediterranean
now, had just carried off all the inhabitants of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Marie, one of the Azores, and might be looked
for round England soon.<a name="Anchor-76" id="Anchor-76"></a><a href="#Footnote-76" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 76.">[76]</a> In 1630 they took six
ships near Bristol and had about forty of their
vessels in British seas.<a name="Anchor-77" id="Anchor-77"></a><a href="#Footnote-77" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 77.">[77]</a> In the following year
they sacked Baltimore in Ireland; but so far
was the English government from being able to
assert itself that Robert Boyle writes of his passage
from Youghal to Bristol past Ilfracombe
and Minehead in 1635, that he passed safely
"though the Irish coasts were then sufficiently
infested with Turkish galleys,"<a name="Anchor-78" id="Anchor-78"></a><a href="#Footnote-78" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 78.">[78]</a> while in 1645
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>they called at Fowey and carried off into slavery
two hundred and forty persons, including some
ladies.<a name="Anchor-79" id="Anchor-79"></a><a href="#Footnote-79" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 79.">[79]</a></p>

<p>Where the English were fortunate was in the
raiders having made so late a start. Throughout
the previous century the inhabitants of south-Europe
coasts were always expecting the Turks.
Philip <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> kept sixteen hundred coast-guardsmen
always patrolling on the lookout for them: but
then he was their chief enemy. More remarkable
is the league<a name="Anchor-80" id="Anchor-80"></a><a href="#Footnote-80" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 80.">[80]</a> of the south of France maritime
towns in 1585 to take steps to prevent their ruin
from this cause; seeing that France had been the
ally of the "Grand Turk" for half a century.
In 1601 the Duke of Mantua and his sister,
the Duchess of Ferrara, were captured close to the
shore near Loreto by a Turkish galley.<a name="Anchor-81" id="Anchor-81"></a><a href="#Footnote-81" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 81.">[81]</a> As for
the tourists themselves, Moryson passed a village
near Genoa destroyed by Turks just before his
arrival, when the belle of the district had been
carried off the day after her wedding; and had
Montaigne been but a few miles nearer to the
coast than he actually was on a certain date we
should perhaps never have had the "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Essais</span>"—thanks
to the Turks. This would have been no
more than a parallel case to that of Padre Jeronimo
Gracián, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Teresa's confessor, who was
captured between Messina and Rome in 1592,
stripped naked, and made to row on the benches
of a galley. He had with him his book "Armonía
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>mistica," which he had just finished, and had to

<p class="mt2">Some preface of this kind is necessary to explain
the view tourists habitually take of the Ottoman
power, because the naval strength is less
often alluded to than its achievements by land
and its position as an Eastern conqueror. But
even these latter call for a word or two to complete
the picture.</p>

<p>While it is true that the phrase concerning "the
empire on which the sun never sets" had been
invented by this time, in reference to that of Spain,
the Turkish was regarded as, to quote a traveller
of 1612, "the greatest that is, or perhaps ever
was from the beginning," just as the phrase "the
sick man of Europe" had also been employed,
but in reference not to Turkey, but to England
(in 1558).<a name="Anchor-83" id="Anchor-83"></a><a href="#Footnote-83" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 83.">[83]</a> To these words may be added those
of another level-headed, well-educated Englishman,
Sir Henry Blount, "the only modern people
great in action and whose empire hath so suddenly
invaded the world and fixed itself on such firm
foundations as no other ever did." Whereas, late
as Blount's visit to Constantinople was, he found
the wiser Turks considering the Christians not
so strong as they used to be; not so strong as the
Persians. Busbecq, too, in his earlier days, sums
up the outlook in despair, concluding that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>worst feature of it all is that the Turks are used
to conquering, the Christians to being conquered;
and confirms it later (when he was sixty-three and
had had thirty-eight years' experience of European
politics, mostly official, including eight years
at Constantinople), by writing that the object of
the Turks' war (1585) with the Persians is to leave
themselves freer to extinguish Christendom, and
that, the former war over, "they will fight us for
existence and empire; and the chances are greatly
in their favour." As late as a century after this
the Turks were besieging Vienna with an army
200,000 strong.</p>

<p>But the test of the hold of a given idea on the
minds of ordinary men, such as these tourists
mostly were, is the frequency with which it recurs
in the works of their favourite writers. Now, badly
off indeed would the seventeenth-century novelist
have been without the Turkish corsair to defer
the wedding-day for a respectable number of
pages; and the echo of the convention has attained
immortality in the stock quotation from
Molière, "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mais que diable allait-il dans cette
galère?</span>" There is a passage, too, in "Othello"
which illustrates the above beliefs still better—Othello's
last words:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
     <div class="verse indent10">Set you down this—</div>
     <div class="verse">And say besides, that in Aleppo once,</div>
     <div class="verse">Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk</div>
     <div class="verse">Beat a Venetian and traduced the State</div>
     <div class="verse">I took by the throat the circumcised dog</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
     <div class="verse">And smote him, thus—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>There are an infinite number of passages in Shakespeare,
whose meaning in relation to the plot
seems so obvious and so sufficient, that the further
half-unconscious sub-meaning is never enquired
into, and is, in fact, passed by until some
special knowledge, like that of the author of the
"Diary of Master William Silence," throws light
on it. In this case, an acqaintance with sixteenth-century
Christian travel in Mohammedan lands
compels the idea that Othello's mind turns at the
last to what he knows his hearers would unhesitatingly
recognise as his greatest deed, the killing
a Turk in Turkish territory; as the greatest possible
claim to forgiveness and to fame. Moryson
left his sword behind him at Venice, as a thing
which it would be madness to use.</p>

<p>The state of mind, then, of the Christian of this
period in face of the Turks may be compared to
that of a Chinaman towards Europeans between
the fall of Pekin and the victories of Japan. As
for the reasons of the Turks' success, as noted by
tourists, they refer primarily to the army, since it
was on the army that the Turks were, and had been,
dependent for their greatness. First, in regard
to the soldiers' behaviour to their own people,
discipline was so severe that the country people
took no precautions against robbery, "whereas,"
says one (an Englishman), "we cannot raise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>two or three companies but they pilfer and rifle
wheresoever they pass." Teetotalism, again, was
prescribed by their religion, and although the
prohibition was losing its force, the infractions
were secret and not practicable in camp. The
benefit of this lay not merely in the freedom from
disorderly behaviour but in the fact that the
carriage of wine was a serious item in the expenses
of a Christian army. Then besides orderliness
and sobriety and the absence from the camp of
gambling and women, there was personal cleanliness
and sanitation. On these two last points the
"Franks," as Europeans were generally known in
the East, had much said to them to which there
was no effective reply, even on their own showing.
It was common knowledge among Europeans who
stayed at home that they were despised in the
East for their carelessness about drainage, and a
typical case concerning cleanliness is that recorded
of one Englishman. One day he fell overboard:
"Now God has washed you," said the Turks.</p>

<p>Another characteristic that rendered the army
more efficient was the extent to which autocracy
was in favour among them, a principle which,
applied throughout all grades, caused discipline
to be a matter of course. Among European
armies there was nothing that could be termed
discipline, only personal influence. In this respect,
both the cause and the effect, the striking resemblance,
in relation to the Europeans contemporary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>with them, of the sixteenth-century Turk
with the modern Japanese, stands out. Other
respects were courtesy, frugality, cleverness in
handicraft and the fine arts, and, on the other
side, lower ideas about women. It was only, likewise,
where the copying of the human form was
concerned that the Turk technique fell below
Western achievement; Della Valle, who was used
to the best that Europe could produce, further
notes their relative excellence in cooking, bookbinding,
tailoring, gardening, and, especially, all
leather work.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 456px;"><a id="i_b_190fp"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_190fp.jpg" width="456" height="400" alt="AN EXAMPLE OF TURKISH FINE ART" />
<div class="caption">AN EXAMPLE OF TURKISH FINE ART</div>
</div>

<p>From our point of view the Franks had also much
to learn from the Turks as to kindness to animals,
but that did not even appear a superfluous virtue
to the former, who only mention it as a curiosity,
except Busbecq, who remarks that Turks' horses
lived the longer for it, were more useful, and were
companions as well as useful.</p>

<p>It may be noted, further, that the Turks had
acquired the use of pyjamas ("linen breeches and
quilted waistcoats," says Fynes Moryson), while
Western Europe was in process of being converted
to night-dresses. Says the contemporary playwright,
Middleton, in his "Mayor of Queenborough,"
"Books in women's hands are as much
against the hair (<i>i. e.</i> against the grain), methinks,
as to see men wear stomachers, or night-rails"
(<i>i. e.</i> night-shirts). Even with ladies the process
was not a short one. N. Brooke, in Southern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>Italy, late in the eighteenth century, discussed
night-wear with a lady there; it was not the
custom to wear anything, she explained, in the
warmer months; for one thing, it was cooler so;
and for another, so much easier to catch the
fleas.</p>


<p class="mt2">It would be strange if among all these visitors
some were not found noting signs of demoralisation.
The chief of these is Moryson, who, without
explaining what means he has of comparing
past and present, finds the Emperors less warlike,
their whole forces not available through fear of
internal rebellion, the pick of the troops not equal
to the pick of times gone by; a shortage of firearms;
a decrease in religious zeal; an increase in
extortion and oppression. This latter Della Valle
notes, too, on his return-journey, when, at Cyprus,
a governor had left, and while a successor
was on the way out, orders came reinstating
the former; which implied bribery and outbidding.</p>

<p>More general are the references to the increase
of wine-drinking in defiance of the prohibition of
it by their religion; a habit which was bound
to be noticed by the traveller, since the ambassadors'
houses were used for the purpose principally,
at first solely. One old gentleman in Busbecq's
time tried to evade his conscience, too;
he gave a great shout before each drink, to warn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>his soul to stow itself away in some far corner
of his body lest it should be defiled by the wine
he was about to enjoy and have hereafter to answer
for his sin. Towards the end of the next century
concealment was abandoned, and at a Greek
village outside Adrianople, whither an Englishman
went during plague-time, he found the population
living by the sale of wine to Turks, who
came in troops to get drunk: the parson did the
biggest trade because he had the biggest warehouse—his
church.</p>

<p>It was frequently noticed, moreover, that their
most capable workmen were mostly foreigners,
and that two inventions which attracted everyone's
notice—carrier-pigeons and incubation,
both practised exclusively in Turkish territory and
the latter on a scale which would qualify the proprietor
for knighthood to-day—were not of Turkish
origin. Nevertheless, the fact remained that
many of the products of civilisation existed
mainly, or at their best, in Turkish dominion
alone; and this, and the prestige it implies, have
to be recognised and remembered as two of the
main facts in sixteenth-century history. It may
be added that in no way can this be so satisfactorily
ascertained as through travellers' narratives.</p>

<p>Yet the Turks were deemed barbarians by the
Frank; he and they practically never spoke each
other's language, which put out of the question
those casual conversations which pave the way to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>mutual understanding. Their faith remained to
him a "filthy error"; and to the Christians, whose
chief bond of unity had just been riven by the Reformation,
the remaining one, that of a common
literature, was all the more to be prized. No Turk,
as one observer remarks, would write history because
no Turk would believe it; it being unsafe to
record the truth, and impracticable to ascertain it.
Accordingly, the complete Livy which the Grand
Signor was reputed to have inherited from the
Byzantine Emperors had only its selling value
to Christians for him. He had refused one offer
of 5000 piastres (about £6500 now) for it, thinking
that the offer proved it was worth more.
But Della Valle knew better than to make offers
to the Grand Signor: the way to buy his books
was to bribe his librarian, and he only missed securing
it for 10,000 crowns (say £12,500) through
the librarian at Constantinople not being able
to trace it.</p>


<p class="mt2">Constantinople—the change from Byzantine
Emperors' days was striking. But the gloriousness
of the position was unchangeable, and the
sight of it from the sea was more glorious than
ever, the finest city to see, then, that earth held.
With its various levels, each one descending as
it was the nearer to the shore, a marvellous proportion
of the roofs, and even windows, came in
view; and the waywardness of the designs, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>the balconies with their lattice-work, were thrown
into relief by the brilliance and the variety of the
colouring; while the colouring itself stood out
against the white of the walls, the green of innumerable
cypresses, and the darkness of the
leaden domes.</p>

<p>But once inside, and all was spoilt. The streets
were very narrow and ill-kept; a raised foot-path
each side took up two-thirds of the way, and the
other third was barely practicable for asses;
carcasses of animals, and even of men, were left
lying there till they rotted. The only street
which was a pleasure to pass was the long straight
one which led from the gate of Adrianople to
the Palace, and was used for all occasions of state,
such as the entrances of ambassadors. Dignity
was a thing that the Turks understood; it was
characteristic that the most impressive procession
to be seen ordinarily in Europe was that
to the Grand Signor's Privy Council, more impressive
even than the Cardinals going to Consistory
at Rome. Yet the private houses, as seen
from the streets, were no more attractive than the
streets themselves: of wood mostly, or wood and
mud. Some fine houses remained from pre-Mohammedan
days, but besides those, only the
mosques, and some other public buildings, were
other than repulsive. The palace that was called
Constantine's was already in ruins, abandoned
but for one great room used as a tent-factory.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>Even the baths were not in all respects superior
to those of dirty Christendom, but that was because
the rich men had private ones. In Turkey
none but the poor used the public baths; in
Christendom few but Germans and the ailing
rich used any. The reason the houses were so
wretched was "that they might not be worth
taking from the child when the father died"; for
the property of a dead man was the Sultan's; the
latter's palace was free from restrictions; only,
few there were who saw it.</p>

<p>This happened sometimes when the court was
away and the tourist could bribe the right man.
Then, besides all that might be expected, he saw
the best Zoo in Europe; and, in the middle of a
wood, a certain pond, all lined with porphyry,
wherein it was one "Grand Signor's" diversion to
send the girls of the harem and shoot at them with
bullets that stuck to their skins without doing
harm; and he could regulate the depth of the
water till they had to keep afloat to breathe;
tiring of that, he let the water down and sent the
eunuchs in to fetch them out—if alive.</p>

<p>The only recognised means, however, of seeing
the inside was to accompany an ambassador on
one of the two occasions when he saw the Grand
Turk; when he came and when he left. This happened
on a Sunday or a Tuesday, and could be
but hurried glimpses while going to and from the
audience chamber to kiss the robe of the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>sovereign whose position was such that the ambassador
was taken off his horse at the gate and
searched and led to the audience by two men, each
one holding a hand. When the English ambassador,
in 1647, at his first audience, did not bow low
enough, the men on either side of him thrust his
head down to the required level.<a name="Anchor-84" id="Anchor-84"></a><a href="#Footnote-84" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 84.">[84]</a> He was further
obliged to be lavish with his presents and content
that they should be received as tribute, and that
no present should be given in return but a garment.
In the estimate for the cost of the embassy which
the above-mentioned French league proposed to
send to Constantinople 2000 <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">écus d'or au soleil</span>
(over £4000), one twelfth of the total cost, is
allotted for presents and tips. Neither did the
Grand Signor ever speak to a Christian.</p>

<p>The interest of life in Constantinople was
largely discounted by the ways of the natives,
for courteous as the Turk was as a man, as a
Mohammedan things were very different. While,
on the one hand, incredible as it may sound, a
Turkish sailor was always civil even if you got
in his way on board ship, a Christian his nation
"regard no more than a dog," and if the Christian
wore green, which was reserved for Mohammed's
kindred, he was lucky to escape injury. One
stranger with a pair of green breeches had them
taken away from him in the street. In any case,
there was a likelihood of ill-usage. No one dared
to refuse, or even hesitate, when a Turk commanded,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>without regretting it, except Della Valle,
who carried a passport from the Grand Turk himself,
and even then, upon his refusal to pay his respects
to a certain governor in the customary way,
which was both undignified and costly, the whole
company were so proud of him that the Greek
nuns could not refrain from kissing him in public.
Typical experiences were those of Moryson, whose
hat struck a Turk one day as so quaint that he
borrowed it for a few minutes for his own use—not
as a hat—and returned it to Moryson's head;
and of one Manwaring<a name="Anchor-85" id="Anchor-85"></a><a href="#Footnote-85" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 85.">[85]</a> in Aleppo;—"we could
not walk in the streets but they would buffet us
and use us very vilely: ... one day I met with a
Turk ... saluting me in this manner: ... took
me fast by one of the ears and so did lead me up and
down the street; and if I did chance to look sour
upon him he would give me such a wring that I did
verily think he would have pulled off my ear and
this he continued with me for the space of one
hour, with much company following me, some
throwing stones at me, and some spitting on me;
and because I would not laugh at my departure
from him, gave me such a blow with a staff that
did strike me to the ground."</p>

<p>But that is not the end of the story. Manwaring
went home and complained to the Janizary
who acted as guardian to his party. The
latter took a stick, found the Turk, who was of
high enough position to go about in cloth of gold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>and crimson velvet, and thrashed him till he
could not stand.</p>

<p>This was a form of protection open to all. The
payment was low; the Janizary's standard of
honour and honesty very high, their power practically
unlimited. Moryson was one of a band of
a hundred, who accidentally set fire to the grass
while cooking their supper. Out came a Janizary
from the local governor and compelled them to
use their clothes to quench the flames; which done,
he drove them all, priests and armed men included,
before him to the governor, with no
weapon but a stick, and whoever lagged behind
he cried, "Wohowe Rooe," and hit him.</p>

<p>But with regard to insults, it must be remembered
that certain characteristics of the Frank the
Turks never ceased to despise. They wished their
enemies "no more rest than a Christian's hat."
Four things especially puzzled them, why (1) the
latter walked about when he might sit down, (2)
wore his hair long when he might get it cut short,
(3) shaved instead of growing a beard, refusing
sometimes to do business with beardless Christians,
believing such to be under age, (4) bought material
for clothes and then cut bits out; themselves
wearing their garments plain.</p>

<p>Barring the results of misunderstanding and
contempt, there was plenty of interest in life in
Constantinople. The Greeks, at any rate, whom
Della Valle visited, were not grievously oppressed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>considering that while among the Turks to be reputed
rich was more dangerous than any crime;
he found the ladies at a wedding dressed in stuff
that cost twelve zecchini a "picco" (at least
£20 a yard) and, as their custom was, they frequently
retired to change their dresses, of which
they brought eight or ten. There were the market
places to see, which were used as a promenade,
especially by the ladies, who in this respect had a
decidedly better opportunity to make acquaintances
than was generally supposed; their veils did
not prevent them making themselves recognised,
and the press of people was sufficiently great to
allow of an "unintentional" dig in the ribs as a
means of introduction to an attractive foreigner.
Tommasetto, Della Valle's servant, was even
more favoured because he conformed to Turkish
standards by growing a beard, and accordingly,
in passing the streets, the ladies frequently
touched his cheeks, saying always the same word,
which he found meant "handsome man!" If,
in the market or elsewhere, a Christian wanted
to buy food, there was no such thing for him as a
fixed price or a bargain; he gave the Turk money
and the Turk gave what he chose to give. Every
Friday was a slave market, where the tourist
might see his countrywomen for sale; a virgin
would fetch about £25, and an average widow £9,
as money is now, and if the tourist was not careful
of his company, he would find himself sold as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>he walked through the streets; Fynes Moryson,
when very ill, was told by the Janizary who was
his guide that an old woman had just offered 100
aspers (thirty shillings) for him.</p>

<p>For the population of Constantinople and what
the population consisted of, nothing more can be
stated than the beliefs on the subject, of which
this one may be mentioned, that in less than
three months in 1615 there died of plague 120,000
Turks, 2000 Jews, and 18,000 Christians. Plague
was always present in Constantinople; no precautions
were taken against it; when a man died
from plague, his clothes were put up for auction
immediately, and bought, and worn. But
the fatalism which decided the Turks' attitude
towards plague did not manifest itself in all directions;
their behaviour in danger at sea was the
reverse of what might be expected on Christian-manned
ships. After they had taken Cyprus,
moreover, which suffered greatly from locusts, it
was prescribed that every farmer should bring a
fixed quantity of locusts' eggs yearly to a stated official,
who was to see the eggs ground to powder and
the powder thrown into the sea. They had their
medicines too, and were the only people in Europe
who had hitherto managed to make medicine-taking
pleasant, because they alone had sherbets and
took medicines in their sherbet. Moreover, what
may be said of drinks applies equally to games.
For swings, they were part of every Turkish festivity;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>likewise roundabouts and "great wheels";
how well acquainted Christians were with all
these may be judged by the fact that both an
Englishman and an Italian describe them all in
detail. Yet with all that we have imported, there
still remains one hint to take. A Mohammedan
crowd kept itself in order for the most part then;
George Sandys, in nine months' stay in Constantinople,
never saw a Mohammedan quarrel with
one of his own creed; but to restrain the excitability
that might occur in a crowd, they had policemen
in leathern jackets, bearing bladders, both
bladders and jackets being smeared with oil and
tar, which commanded the respect of the cleanly
Turks in their most youthful moments.</p>

<p>The relations between Turks and Christians
being what they were, it is not surprising that one
feature of life in the sixteenth century as seen by
travellers should be more often under notice in
Turkish dominion than elsewhere, at any rate to
the traveller who was a Christian—examples of
human misery. Many such there are scattered
about the pages under notice, such and such a
name comes up, probably for the only time in any
writing that remains, just an incident connected
with it, or a life-history in a few lines; nothing
else known of the man or ever likely to be, oblivion
before and oblivion after; just that one glimpse of
utter misery. There is the merchant of Ragusa in
Blount's caravan who was defiant towards some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>Turks; beaten with axes and iron maces, two ribs
broken; left behind helpless; of him it is very unlikely
there was anything further to tell beyond
what the wolves knew. Then there was another
whom Blount came across by the side of the Danube,
formerly a man and a Christian, now castrated
and a Turk; enduring degradation and remorse
only so as to be able to revenge himself by
throwing Turkish children into the river at night;
every week had its victim. One John Smith,
again, became a Venetian soldier and was sent to
Crete, where he borrowed forty-eight shillings
(say twelve guineas) from his officer. Being unable
to pay it when the five years' term of service
was up, he was turned over to the officer's successor
with his debt; so again at the end of the tenth
year. There Lithgow found him at the end of
fifteen years, no nearer release, and paid his debt
and obtained a passage back for him. Then there
was the sailor-traveller who was made a galley
slave by the Turks and was placed beside an old
Russian. Twenty-four years had the latter been
there; attempts to escape had been without result
beyond the loss of ears and nose, and he was under
threat of burning for the next attempt; yet he was
only waiting for a man who was ready to be his
companion. The sailor-traveller was ready; and
they succeeded, after swimming two miles with a
three-headed arrow right through the old Russian's
thigh.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>
<p>But, indeed, these individual Turks and Christians
were no more than carrying out in person
the general relations that existed between the
races. That the former's navy reached the Atlantic,
their army to Vienna, and their shadow
over all Europe, has already been illustrated; and
also that they were setting an example in many of
the directions which imply being ahead in civilisation,
summed up in verse which Gruberus-of-the-guide-book
quotes as an aid to remembering the
notabilia of Turkey.</p>

<p>More than all these, in sixteenth-century eyes,
was the fact that they possessed Constantinople,
recognised as the city whose possession necessarily
carried with it the political headship of the world
by reason of its situation taken in conjunction
with its imperial associations. They dominated
Greece, also, the source of intellectual light, and
Egypt, the home of science. More than all these,

</div>

<p>From all points of view except that of geography
Jerusalem was forming part of Europe; the spot
where was localised what was recognised as the
prime factor in their mental and spiritual ancestry,
life, and future. What it is now to a convinced
Zionist, it was then to the average Christian.
But the idea of securing Jerusalem as an axiom,
almost an incidental axiom, of practical politics
requires, perhaps, a word or two of explanation,
considering how far the modern habit of weeding
out theology from all politics but party-politics
has gone; and this the more so since little help is
to be had from histories, written, as they naturally
are, to defend, attack, or explain the present
rather than the past, and dealing, consequently,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>with the past, only in so far as it throws light,
not on itself, but on things current.</p>

<p>History having become specialised into accounts
of the political events of the past in relation
to to-day and to-morrow, the interest of
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries has come
to be concentrated on the development of national
and centralised governments. It is therefore
left out of account that the ideas at the
back of the average sixteenth century man's
mind were such as assumed that the world, and
Europe in particular, was under theocratic government;
and consequently that what seem to us
independent sovereigns developing national monarchies
seemed to him so many deputies of the
Almighty—"many," because of the sins of the
world—ruling by permission until the appointed
time should come for the unification of Europe
under the one true head, the completion of whose
work would be a final gigantic Crusade which
would pulverise the Turk and secure Jerusalem for
Christianity, world without end. In fact, the conquest
of Jerusalem held much the same place in
international politics as "disarmament" with us;
just so far ideal as to make discussion of it interesting,
and sufficiently impracticable to be common
ground. If these ideas seem too mediæval
to be attributed to the sixteenth century, it is because
their more "modern" ideas have been disproportionately
insisted on since; seven-eighths of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>their life was mediæval—and a large part of the
remaining eighth the majority would have wished
to disown.</p>

<p>Where the leaven of new ideas was showing itself
was not in a cessation, but in a decrease, of
pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The state of transition
is definitely marked by the diversity of the preoccupations
which men carried thither; the change
itself by the discontinuance of the pilgrim galleys.
This took place between 1581 and 1586. It had
been usual for two galleys to sail to Jaffa and back
each year specially for pilgrims, from Venice,
starting on different dates between Ascension Day
and early in July; the latter date being dictated by
the weather, the former doubtless by everybody's
desire to wait to witness the Espousal of the Sea.
In 1581 a boat<a name="Anchor-87" id="Anchor-87"></a><a href="#Footnote-87" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 87.">[87]</a> started on May 7 or 8 with fifty-six
on board, all told; this was wrecked in the Adriatic,
thirty persons only being saved. On July 14,
another left, but the pilgrims by this had to change
into a smaller vessel at Cyprus. In 1587, however,
a guide-book writer,<a name="Anchor-88" id="Anchor-88"></a><a href="#Footnote-88" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 88.">[88]</a> advising on the basis of his
experiences the previous year, tells the pilgrim to
take the first boat to Tripoli in the spring, before
Easter if possible, otherwise there may be none
towards Palestine till August, since the pilgrim-galleys
have ceased sailing, although the procession
is still kept up at Venice in which every intending
pilgrim had the honour of walking on the
right hand of a noble, bearing a lighted wax candle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>That this discontinuance was sudden and
recent may be assumed from the fact that a priest
who was visiting the shrines of Christendom as
the deputy of Philip <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>, who had vowed such a
pilgrimage when his son was ill, hurried<a name="Anchor-89" id="Anchor-89"></a><a href="#Footnote-89" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 89.">[89]</a> on his
way to Italy in 1587, expecting to find a pilgrim-galley
ready to start. But that this discontinuance
was not merely temporary is clear enough from
all subsequent writers.</p>

<p>The complement of a pilgrim-galley may be
taken as about one hundred, although in 1561 one
carried four hundred. After 1581 nobody mentions
finding more than twenty-three "Franks"
at Jerusalem together, not even at Easter, when
"indulgences" were doubled. Possibly the attack
on "indulgences" which prefaced the best-known
schism of the century suggested, or testifies to,
an incredulity concerning them which might be
felt far outside the districts which persisted in
schism. If felt, this would re-act on pilgrimages,
the nominal object whereof was to secure "indulgences."
On the other hand, there is no reason for
assuming a decline in devotion; the non-Catholic
point of view is well expressed by Moryson:—"I
had no thought to expiate any least sin of mine;
much less did I hope to merit any grace from God—yet
I confess that through the grace of God the
very places struck me with a religious horror and
filled my mind with holy motions." One reason
for the decrease is certain, however, and sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>to account for it alone; the increase in the dangers
and the cost of the journey through the stopping-places
on the route falling into the hands of the
Turks, and, still more, the changed attitude of the
Turks towards Western Christians as a result of
these victories.</p>


<p class="mt2">Yet this abolition of the direct and speedy route
was not all loss to him who was as much tourist as
pilgrim. He saw the more. There was a pleasant
choice of routes, too; for, of course, thenceforth
each one had to make his own arrangements.
The main routes numbered three; on each of
them further choice was possible. The three were
viâ (1) Jaffa, (2) Damascus, (3) Cairo.</p>

<p>The starting-point was sometimes Marseilles,
but rarely; almost invariably it would be Venice.
Here, too, information was obtainable better than
elsewhere. At the Franciscan monastery "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Della
Vigna</span>" was a travel-bureau in charge of the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Padre
Provisore di Gierusalemme</span>" who survived
the galleys: in 1609 he was a Venetian noble. The
post had a semi-official character, since its holder
was charged to view the permit to visit Jerusalem,
the "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Placet</span>" as it was called, lacking which a
Roman Catholic would incur excommunication;
and also to assure himself that the pilgrim had
one hundred zecchini to spend, in the absence of
which the permit was cancelled. The respect in
which this "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Placet</span>," which required eleven signatures,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>was held was immense; one soldier, even,
who had touched at Tripoli and Jaffa in the course
of serving Ferdinand de' Medici, came back to
Leghorn to get leave before visiting Jerusalem.
But the warden of the friars at Jerusalem had
authority to absolve from the excommunication
such as did not pass through Italy. No "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Placets</span>"
were granted to women.</p>

<p>These preliminaries over, a start for Jaffa
would be made by taking ship for one of the
islands in the Levant on the chance of finding another
ship thence to Jaffa itself, which extended
the four-five weeks' voyage of earlier days into
one of unknown duration. Arriving at Jaffa, past
the rock from which <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter had his fishing-lesson,
no city was to be seen; little but two
towers.</p>

<div class="caption">PILGRIMS LEAVING JAFFA FOR JERUSALEM, 1581</div>
</div>

<p>In times gone by when the pilgrims arrived in
bulk, word was sent to the warden of the monastery
of San Salvatore at Jerusalem, and they did
not start the land journey till he came to supervise
it. But now the traveller had to arrange as best
he could with Turk or Arab and reach Rama
somehow or other; probably on an ass without
saddle, bridle, or stirrups. At Rama he would
find Sion House, built by Philip the Good on the
site of the house of Nicodemus, and nominally a
monastery; all the monks had gone, but it remained
a lodging for pilgrims. At Rama dwelt
the official Christian guide to Jerusalem, into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>whose charge you had no choice but to commit
yourself; if any one tried to evade his control and
charges, the dragoman could send word to the
Arabs, and life passed the limit of barely endurable,
which was the pilgrim's ordinary lot. The
dragoman dwelt at Rama for the reason that the
routes to Jerusalem, west, north, and south, converged
there; and for that same reason we will go
on to consider route No. 2, viâ Damascus.</p>

<p>There was at times the chance of approaching
by the Damascus road, and yet going mainly by
sea; that was when there was a ship bound for
Acre or some port on the coast of the Holy Land
other than Jaffa. But in practically all cases the
Damascus route meant getting to Constantinople
first, and this is equally true of route No. 3.</p>

<p>From Europe to Constantinople there were
several main routes. Two tourists took the trade
route from Danzig through Lemberg to Kamenetz,
the frontier town of Poland, then down the
river Pruth to Reni, a centre of the caviare
trade, and so down the Danube to its mouth and
by sea to Constantinople, which last part coincided
with the route of the Russian pilgrims who
sailed down the Dnieper or the Don and coasted
along the Black Sea shore. A weird crew on a
weird journey, in boats which, big or little, were
used to being mounted on wheels, through country
where nothing living was to be seen but wild
beasts and nothing to mark distances save the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>mouths of tributary streams. Then there was
Busbecq's way, who used the Danube, but not to
the mouth; leaving it soon after Belgrade had
been passed and travelling by the great road
through Sofia and Adrianople along which the
Grand Signor marched to bring war and Christian
ambassadors came to buy peace. From this road,
going westward, diverged the roads to Spalato
and to Ragusa, the two most direct ways to Venice.
Yet but few tourists travelled by these two
roads. It was not that they were little used. Besides
the ambassadors to Constantinople from
Ragusa itself, which meant at least two journeys
each year on account of the tribute, Della Valle
speaks of the ordinary post taking that direction
and the Venetian representative at Constantinople
keeping forty Schiavonians for post work,
who travelled on foot. The mountain passes were
terrible, and the danger from wolves and dogs in
Servia considerable; also from robbers. At certain
points on Mount Rhodope, for instance, men
were stationed to beat drums when the road was
supposed to be clear of them, and a feature of the
district was the "Palangha," a roughly fortified
enclosure large enough for sixty or seventy Turks
to live within and to serve as a temporary shelter
to those who lived roundabout; for the robber
bands sometimes numbered three hundred. Except
at the regular stopping places few people
were seen, for the Christians established their villages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>off the main road for fear of the Turks, who
were so far uncertain of their control over them
as to use continual severities. A French ambassador,
whose guide led him astray near one of
these villages, saw all the inhabitants making off
to the mountains, mistaking him for a Turkish
official. And their houses he says were no better
than "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gabions couverts</span>." But with these, as
with all people who live under a despotism, especially
a foreign military one, their chief protection
consisted in appearing more miserable than they
were; there was no part of Europe where food was
better or cheaper; neither did the people treat
strangers with the ferocity produced by extreme
wretchedness, and at Sofia, in fact, Blount found
the opposite extreme—"nor hath it yet lost the
old Grecian civility, for of all the cities I ever
passed, either in Christendom or without, I never
saw anywhere where a stranger is less troubled
either with affronts or with gaping."</p>

<p>Still, it was borderland, and mainly Mohammedan;
the sea route was common ground and
frequented by Christians. But there was a compromise
which was often in use—to travel by sea
to Zante and thence through Greece, finishing the
journey either by sea or land. It might seem that
this direction would appeal to a considerable proportion
of tourists during the period that is called
"Renascence," but the extent to which the acquaintance
with, and interest in, Greek thought,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>first-hand, at this time has been exaggerated may
be accurately estimated by the fact that not a
single one of these travellers visited Athens except
by accident. It must be admitted, however, that
things were not made easy for them; one of those
who traversed Greece was Dallam, in company
with seven others; part of the journey they were
stalked by natives trying to arrange with their
guide to cut their throats: and every time they
slept but once it was in their clothes, either on the
ground or on the floor. One of the most interesting
places that might be visited on this route was
Salonica, a Jew republic under the suzerainty of
the Grand Signor, with a training-school for
priests; here and Safed near Galilee were the only
places where Hebrew was supposed to be spoken.</p>

<p>All these ways to Constantinople have been
mentioned in the order into which they fall according
to the extent to which they were used
by European tourists, the least frequented first.
Last comes the most usual, by sea all the way from
Venice. And here, however different might be the
experiences of this one and that one, two points of
interest were invariable. First, they passed Abydos
and Sestos, where out must come the note-book,
and Leander must be dragged into it. Secondly,
Troy. The learned say that these tourists located
Troy on the south, instead of on the north, bank
of the river, but the more important point is that
what they did see stirred their feelings: it was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>mere mild interest. The Trojan heroes were as
real to them as Barbarossa and Don Juan, not
only because no doubts had blurred their individuality,
much less darkened their existence, but
because there was less competition for the position
of hero owing to the narrower range of their
knowledge. Another characteristic of theirs, was
that Virgil was clearer in their association of
ideas, Homer dimmer, at the moment of seeing
Troy's ruins, than would be the case with a modern
tourist: the quotation that arises most naturally
in the mind of the finest scholar of them all
was</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And so to Constantinople. But not the pilgrims'
Constantinople of former days, as marvellous
a centre, perhaps, of ecclesiastical civilisation
and dignity, and of relics, as has been seen. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Sophia was still there and its doors still of the
wood of Noah's ark, but it was a mosque where
the inquisitive Christian was allowed to look
round on sufferance. Only two churches in the
city were allowed to remain in Western Christian
hands, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas and Our Lady of Constantinople,
the latter still a place of pilgrimage though
served by one solitary Dominican friar. Gone
was Moses' rod; gone from the neighbouring village
of Is Pigas was the fresco of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>whose head, in the first week of each Lent, had
blossomed a milk-white rose; gone was the trumpet
that sounded at the fall of Jericho and the
horn of Abraham's ram. But the last two must
be safe somewhere, for they are to be used by the
summoning angel on Judgment Day.</p>

<p>As a pilgrim, then, the tourist reached Constantinople
only by the way. And setting out thence
for Jerusalem, viâ Damascus, he might go by land
in one of three ways, either by trading caravan, in
which case he should contract with some one in it
for all expenses and necessaries by the way, besides
engaging a Janizary, necessary under every possible
condition, who is to report his passenger's
safe arrival to an ambassador or some merchant
residing at the point of departure; or he might
accompany a governor on his way to take up his
duties (and changes were very frequent), in
which case the governor had better be required
to swear by his head to see the pilgrim safely
through; or for the third, and quickest way, on the
return journey, accompany the carriers of revenue
to Constantinople. But it was far commoner to
make a sea-journey of it, which meant taking ship
to "Scanderoon" and thence by land, viâ Aleppo,
to Damascus. Nobody ever went to Scanderoon
except to get to Aleppo; sometimes not even then,
for during this period the port of Aleppo was as
often as not Tripoli. The objection to Scanderoon
was its unhealthiness, lying, as it did, as Peter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>Mundy says, "in a great marsh full of boggs, foggs,
and froggs"; of the English who went there as apprentices
scarcely five per cent lived to go into business
for themselves. Aleppo was worth seeing: a
pleasant town with its approaches all gardens, like
Damascus, and the medley of nations must have
been marvellous to watch; a sign of its cosmopolitanism
was that Christians were allowed to ride
horses there, an unusual privilege in Mohammedan
dominion; probably nowhere outside Venice
were so many sects represented, whose churches
were in what was called the new suburb; two Armenian,
a Greek, and a Catholic Maronite were
actually side by side, with a Syrian Jacobite
church just near. It is not out of place to add that
at the Jews' synagogue there was not the usual
division of sexes, but that the only separation was
that one side was reserved for the families who had
been long resident there, the other for strangers:
because although the repulsion felt for the Jews
was greater at this time than at present, the interest
in them was likewise greater, and any information
concerning their customs was regarded
by the tourist as matter for his readers—a surprising
number of these tourists give eye-witness
accounts of circumcisions of Jewish babies.</p>

<p>To return to Aleppo; it was equally remarkable
for its trade. Dealings to the extent of 40,000
to 100,000 crowns were ordinary, and this implied
frequency of caravans to take the pilgrim on to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>Damascus. On the way he would pass the district
in which Job was supposed to have lived, which
may well have been so, says Moryson, for no spot
possessed such conveniences for getting robbed,
even of 100,000 head of cattle, nor any better
suited to develop patience.</p>

<p>It was here the pilgrim became acquainted
with the Arabs. How far the latter were independent
of the Turks was left an unsettled question,
but it is fairly certain that on many, perhaps
most, of the occasions when a European traveller
of the time relates an encounter with the
Arabs, the latter were not the robbers he thought
them but keepers of the roads demanding not
more than treble what they were entitled to. But
it is equally clear that hostilities were perpetual.
In 1601 a caravan guide told an Englishman at
one defile that he had never passed by there without
seeing bodies of murdered men; and from
Damascus to Jacob's bridge—so called because
just by was the spot where Jacob wrestled with
the Angel—the caravan travelled by night for
fear of the Arabs and no talking was allowed without
the captain's special permission. But there
was much to divert the attention of the faithful
from their trials. At Damascus was Ananias'
house, and soon after starting an ill-informed
tourist would be surprised to see all his fellow
travellers fall on their knees for prayers: it would
be the spot where the conversion of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>place. Before reaching the Sea of Galilee they
came upon a field with a little well in it, at which
all dismounted for worship as well as for a drink;
there had Joseph been hidden by his brethren.
Between Cana and <abbr title="Mount">Mt.</abbr> Tabor was a little chapel
to call at, built on the spot where Christ had
multiplied the loaves and fishes, and after this
the road turned westwards to Nazareth and the
church on the site where the Virgin Mary's house
had stood before it had been spirited away to
Loreto; two porphyry columns were standing on
the places occupied respectively by the Archangel
and by the Virgin at the moment of the Annunciation.
For those who were not Roman Catholics
there was the actual house there to be identified
on its original site, so far as it had been left intact
by previous pilgrims; Lithgow, the only Western
Christian in the caravan he travelled with, asserts
that his companies carried away above five thousand
pounds' weight of the house in remembrance.
Then southward, joining the road from Tripoli,
more frequented, but not by pilgrims, who chose
this Damascus road as passing through Galilee.
And so to Rama, where they may await such as
journey by route 3 from Constantinople viâ Cairo.</p>

<p>Reaching Alexandria it was found to be about
the size of Paris; besides the ruins, the greatness
of which was attested by the intolerable dust
which was all that remained of much of the building
materials of the past.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>
<p>Leaving Alexandria for Cairo, it was a matter
of course to go by river, passing an attractive
town every four miles or so, a very pleasant journey
except when the Nile was low, which made it
more practicable for the Arabs to attack. On
landing at Bulak, the port, there would be asses
ready, the wonderful asses of the East celebrated
of old in Western Europe, as the canticle witnesses
which used to be sung at Beauvais cathedral at
the feast of the Circumcision when the ass enters
in the procession.<a name="Anchor-90" id="Anchor-90"></a><a href="#Footnote-90" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 90.">[90]</a></p>

<p>The asses of Bulak fortified tradition by carrying
passengers into the city, unattended by any boy,
and taking their way back as soon as the ride was
over.</p>

<p>The characteristics of Cairo which impressed
themselves most on the seventeenth-century traveller
were its size, and, notwithstanding its size,
its populousness, so great that it was difficult to
move for the press of people. Allowances must
be made, however, for their standard regarding
streets; a large proportion of the ten thousand
streets were in reality passages built over, dark
and dangerous to an extent which probably exists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>in few European slums nowadays. The number
ten thousand sounds suspicious as a statement
of fact, but there was a certain check on it, inasmuch
as each "street" was shut at each end by a
gate at night and each gate had a guardian as
well as a lantern burning; and the number of
guardians was twenty thousand besides the four
thousand soldiers who patrolled inside the city
at night. For the antiquities, there were still to
be seen many houses bearing a chalice and two
lighted candles, witnesses of Louis <abbr title="the ninth">IX</abbr>'s captivity
in Egypt and the tale of his leaving the sacrament
as security for the payment of his ransom on his
release; for the rest, knowledge was not in a very
advanced state; everything that was not credited
to "Pharaoh" was put down to Joseph.</p>

<p>The interest to the tourist centred equally in
the excursions. It was but a few miles to Matarea—to
use the Italian spelling, preferable with
many of the names that occur, especially in this
chapter, as a sign of the times—and no Roman
Catholic omitted it, seeing that there stood the
house where Our Lady dwelt for some years after
her flight from Palestine; at Cairo itself was preserved
some of the water in which she washed her
baby-clothes. Neither, naturally, was any one
inclined to pass on without a visit to the Pyramids;
no doubt Della Valle's name is still to be
found cut on the top of the Great Pyramid on the
facet that looks towards Italy. He entered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>Great Pyramid, the only one into which entrance
was effected at this date; but had no opportunity
of saying anything regarding it out of the ordinary;
it is when he moved on to what were known
as the "Pyramids of the Mummies" that his
account of his doings again becomes one of the
most remarkable, as well as one of the best written,
of research in Egypt. He made a halt at "Abusir,"
and then after entering one of these minor Pyramids,
moved on to "Saccara," the centre for
mummy-hunting, which formed the occupation of
the boys of the village. On Della Valle's arrival
they had a stand-up fight for the privilege of taking
him home, and the next morning about fifty
were at his door. A procession having been
formed, all were set to work in different places
probing for tombs, for Della Valle was bent on
examining such as had never been opened hitherto.
His trouble and expense were well rewarded,
for the two mummies he brought away intact
were pronounced at Cairo to be the most remarkable
that any one there remembered seeing. They
cost him three piastri—less than five pounds in
our money at present values—each, and are now
in Dresden Museum. It was rare for any to be seen
intact, for hunting for mummies was not carried
on for museums, but because of their supposed
medicinal value, greatest, it was thought, in virgin-mummies;
one of the rare qualities of Othello's
handkerchief consisted in its having been</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>Mummies were therefore broken up as soon as
found, and sold piecemeal; sometimes also to
painters, who by means of them obtained certain
shades of brown otherwise unattainable. There
was, nevertheless, an Englishman, named John
Sanderson, who brought one away intact, besides
six hundred pounds of fragments to sell to London
apothecaries, in spite of mummy being contraband
export from Egypt.</p>

<div class="caption">AT MOUNT SINAI</div>

<p>A third, and the chief, excursion was to Sinai
and the Red Sea. It is no exaggeration to say that
for most it was a terrible experience; there were
many who visited Mohammedan lands often and
some who saw Jerusalem more than once, but not
one went a second time to Sinai. No big caravans
travelled that way, few were the merchants who
traded to Suez; it meant, then, being subject to
the pleasure of the Arabs. There privation was
the best that could be looked for, they were dependent
for their lives and the endurance of life
on their own enforced liberality and the chance of
forbearance from others; and very thankful must
they have been when they caught sight of the two
great towers, since pulled down, which stood in
the suburbs of Cairo for landmarks to those coming
from Suez, although they might expect to receive
a welcome, as they had probably had a send-off,
from the boys of Cairo in the shape of dirt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>bricks, and bad lemons. Two Germans were reduced
to such a state as to become subject to
hallucinations.</p>

<p>Especially strange did the journey seem to a
Russian who passed by the Cairo route to Jerusalem.
So totally different a desert from those he
knew,—neither forests nor vegetation, no people,
no water; nothing but sand and stones, except for
the Red Sea. And it happens that here, in particular,
does he show how far more second-hand was
his knowledge of the Bible stories than was that
of other Europeans. The function of the cloud
which is said to have accompanied the Israelites
by day on their flight was, to him, to hide them
from pursuers, and at the Red Sea there were still
visible to him the twelve ways that Moses had
opened up for his people, one for each tribe, marked
on the surface of the water by a deeper tint, and
the prints of Pharaoh's chariot-wheels were as
indelible as ever for him, whereas Christians from
farther west ceased to see them soon after the
beginning of the sixteenth century. Some facts
were even more exclusively his own, as that Pharaoh's
soldiers were changed into fish after their
drowning; and were to be known when caught
by having human heads, men's teeth and noses,
though their ears had grown to fins; nobody eats
them. Pharaoh's horses were likewise fishified;
hairy fish with skins as thick as your finger.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that every scene from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>Hebrew history was localised to a square foot;
but there was, besides, a rock to be seen written
over in characters that none could decipher, yet
identified by tradition as the writing of Jeremiah
the prophet done with his finger. This rock was
near the monastery. Hither came the pilgrim, to
find the gate barred, whether he had sent word
of his approach or not; the monastery was surrounded
as a rule by two or three hundred Arabs,
howling day and night, and sometimes threatening,
for food; let down every now and then from
a window high up. Once inside, there was the
monks' well to see, the very same one at which
Moses watered Jethro's sheep, and a chapel behind
the choir built over the spot where had stood
the burning bush that Moses saw; with Our Lady
and her Baby standing in the middle thereof unharmed,
say the Russian pilgrims. Then to bed;
and in the morning, after being wakened, maybe,
by a monk calling his brethren to "offices" by
striking spears of wood and iron with a stick, for
bell they had none, a start would be made up
what was assumed to be <abbr title="Mount">Mt.</abbr> Horeb, at the foot of
which, on the side nearest Cairo, lay the monastery.
Not far from the top were four chapels, one
dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Elijah, at the back of which was
the grotto where he hid from Jezebel, forty days,
fasting. At the top was the rock behind which
Moses lay while God passed, and, hard by, the
church of the Holy Summit and a mosque—it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>was a pilgrimage place for Mohammedans, too.
Then down again the farther side to the valley
between <abbr title="Mounts">Mts.</abbr> Horeb and Sinai, to the hospice
where pilgrims stayed the night.</p>

<p>Before reaching Sinai, and after leaving it,
these travellers are in the habit of making assertions
so flatly contradictory that some of them
will be hardly put to it on Judgment Day; but
when at Sinai, there is only one opinion—to get
to the top thereof was the most terrific struggle
they had ever gone through. Only one account
has the least suggestion of enjoyment in it, Della
Valle's; and yet his ascent was made under worse
conditions than any other's.</p>

<p>It was one Christmas. In the night snow had
fallen; the morning promised more snow. Only
one monk was found to act as guide; but Della
Valle was ready, and his servants would go wherever
he chose to lead them; two Arabs were bribed
into carrying food. So a start was made; Della
Valle in the pilgrim's tunic which he always wore
in holy places, but tucked up high this time; and
all with sticks cut from the tree whence Moses cut
his rod. First went the monk, taking the rocks
like a young deer; and he must have known his
way well, for the stones which marked the way
could not have been visible for snow. At first it
was just wet; then they met the snow; higher up
it came to mid-thigh; still higher, still deeper.
Farther still, where in the best of weathers it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>a place for hands and knees, it was all frozen; more
snow was falling and the wind terrific. The interpreter
gave himself up for dead, cursed the monk
who encouraged the ascent, commended himself
to God and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Catherine, remembered his sins,
and forswore meat on every Monday that he
might live to see. However, they did reach the
top, where, once upon a time, the angels laid <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Catherine's body for a while; and saw the hard
stone which retained the imprint of her body
where she had lain and of the angels' posteriors
where they sat, one at each side of her head, and
one at her feet. They prayed, eat, and forthwith
started to descend, to reach the hospice that
night. What with snow and mist they could often
see but a foot or two before them, and their idea of
descending under the conditions was to toboggan
on their backs; the only risk being, he says, that
of getting buried in snowdrifts, which was no real
risk, because they never all got buried at the same
time. However, once he found himself sitting on
the edge of a precipice with his legs dangling; and
yet, in the end, no casualties occurred except to
one of Della Valle's shoes, and he and his servants,
after buying some of the little rings the monks
provided by way of souvenirs, made of gold, of
silver, and of bone, went back to Cairo to prepare
for the other journey across the desert, to Gaza
and Rama.</p>

<p>Cairo to Gaza was twelve days' journey by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>caravan, but an Arab could do it in four days. A
merchant-pilgrim who had to rejoin his ship at
Alexandria by a certain date in 1601 could find no
way of return except under the escort of the Arabs
to whom a friendly Moor introduced him. They
travelled on dromedaries at first, but he changed
to horseback towards the end to save his life from
death by jolting. One evening his dromedary ran
away, and the two Arabs pursued it out of sight,
and there were the Moor and the merchant alone
in the desert with night descending on them, not
to mention other Arabs who had taken no oaths
to respect their lives and pockets, but who eventually
postponed beheading them till their guides
returned.</p>

<p>An Arab guide meant safety from the chief
danger of the desert, that of the Arab bands who
laid in wait for every caravan and attacked small
ones; in 1611 a caravan of three hundred camels
was carried off bodily. The average number of
persons in a caravan seems to have been about
one thousand and the number of camels three for
every four persons, besides the extra ones that
would be required for merchandise; a camel carried
two persons, and one camel luggage for four,—no
small load, for each one had to provide for
himself as if he was about to set up housekeeping.
The camel had this advantage over the horse, that
the latter and his fodder were more coveted by the
Arab than the former; and it was all one whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>the Arab took horse and fodder or fodder only,
for there was none to be bought and the horse
would starve if left with the owner. The camels
used for caravan purposes were not the small ones
the Arabs were accustomed to, but the large ones,
on which alone, at that time, at any rate, was it
customary to travel in cradles, one cradle slung
each side of the camel. They were comfortable,
these cradles; comfortable enough to sleep in,
hooded and lined to defend the traveller from sun
and weather, with a secret pocket in the seat for
valuables. The camels themselves were protected
against the evil eye by charms written by dervishes
slung round their necks in leathern bags;
and on special occasions they were painted orange
from head to foot, like the Polish horses.</p>

<p>Three of the halts were beside castles maintained
by the Turks; elsewhere there was always
the chance of an Arab chief enquiring if there were
Franks in the caravan and then inviting himself
to dinner; after dinner he would want a present,
would probably name his needs, and lucky was
one particular tourist whose guest only asked for
some sugar and a pair of shoes. That the Arab
was born to command and the Frank to obey,
was an axiom with Franks and caravan-leaders,
except to Della Valle, who always showed fight
and always won; it is to be hoped that none of the
other tourist-pilgrims came to know later how
much money they would have saved had they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>known the effect of gunpowder, even minus the
bullet, on an Arab.</p>

<p>At Gaza the caravan would split. The tourist
would accompany those who were for Damascus,
whose way lay through Rama, where, as already
mentioned, all pilgrim ways met. Then to Jerusalem.
At the gate the pilgrim's weapons were
taken from him and his name registered in a
book, to assure that his tribute should not be
overlooked. Then the resident representative
of his sect took charge of him; if he was a Frank
he went to the Roman Catholic monastery of San
Salvatore, whether Protestant or not. There was
one Calvinist at this time who preferred to deal
direct with the Turks rather than endanger his
soul; but this meant money to the monks and he
found himself in prison, from which he was only
released by influence. The fact was that none of
the Protestant rulers contributed to the upkeep
of any foundation at Jerusalem and all Western
Europeans were consequently classed together as
in days gone by. At the monastery he would be
fairly certain to make the acquaintance of Giovanni
Battista, the monastery guide, for by 1612
he had filled that post for twenty-five years; and
he it was from whom pilgrims derived most of
their information during their stay—in Italian;
if their knowledge of Italian was hazy, it probably
added one or two marvels to those he meant to
tell them. And, indeed, this may be said of most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>of these tourists on most of their journeys; much
of the information they retail, in their own books
and in this, they acquired by word of mouth in a
language they only half understood.</p>

<p>Of Jerusalem as a town they say that the walls
were the best part of the building; that there were
three Christians living there to every Turk; that
the Christians dwelled there for devotion and the
Turks for the income derived from the Christians,
and that otherwise it would have been wholly
deserted. Partially deserted it actually was, since
for the scarcity of human beings in its streets it is
compared to Padua, the emptiest city in Europe,
by one Englishman. All the trades driven there
were elementary ones, shoemakers, cooks, smiths,
tailors; and Moryson, on being seen walking about
with gloves and a shirt, was taken for a prince in
spite of his being poorly dressed otherwise; although
that did not prevent the natives egging on
their children to leap on to his back from upper
stories and snatch things from him.</p>

<p>But just consider the sights in these streets!
Passing over the localisations of New Testament
incidents (such as where the Apostles composed
the Creed and Christ the Lord's prayer) so exact
and frequent that one must have had to walk
slowly to avoid missing them when the guide
pointed them out, there were besides the houses
of Annas, Zebedee, Caiaphas, Veronica, Dives,
Mary Magdalen, Uriah the Hittite, Pilate, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>nightly were heard noises and whippings and sighs,
and of the school which Our Lady attended; the
orchard where Bathsheba bathed and the terrace
from which David beheld her; the fountain where
Our Lady used to wash her baby-clothes; the
stone on which the cock stood to crow at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Peter's downfall, and another which had been the
seat of the angel who told the Marys of Christ's
resurrection, etc., etc.</p>

<p>These were every-day matters. To see Jerusalem
at its best one had to go at Easter, when the
concourse of pilgrims was greatest for two reasons:
first, the only excursion to Jordan took place;
secondly, the descent of the Holy Fire from heaven
into the church of the Holy Sepulchre. The
incidents of the season are described in detail by
George Sandys, Lithgow, Coryat and Della Valle,
who were there at Easter in the years 1611, 1612,
1614, and 1616 respectively. On Palm Sunday
the warden of the monastery set out for Bethphage
in the afternoon and returned riding on an
ass, the people shouting "Hosanna, etc.," and
strewing the way with boughs and garments.
When Lithgow was there they made too much
noise to please the Turks and therefore returned
black with bruises and somewhat bloody, the
warden not excepted. In the evening the warden
had recovered far enough to give an address to
the Frank pilgrims, entreating the Protestants
to refrain from reviling what they did not agree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>with, and concluding with the advice that three
things were preëminently needful for a Jerusalem
pilgrim; Faith (to believe what was told him),
Patience (with the Turks), and Money.</p>

<p>On Maundy Thursday came the ceremony of
washing the pilgrims' feet by the warden, and
great was his disgust if he found that he had
washed and kissed the feet of a Protestant. Some
spent the next three nights in the church of the
Holy Sepulchre, some only Easter Eve; a survival
of the pre-Christian idea of the healing influence
of passing a night in a temple.<a name="Anchor-91" id="Anchor-91"></a><a href="#Footnote-91" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 91.">[91]</a> Those who could
not afford, or borrow, the heavy entrance-fee,
never entered but stood outside and wept, or
looked through the round hole in the door through
which food was passed. Inside, it made all the
difference whether or no the Oriental Palm Sunday
or Easter Day fell on the Frank Easter.
If so, the Frank would find the number in the
church of the Holy Sepulchre anything between
one and two thousand, many belonging to nations
he had never heard of, all frantic with excitement,
dancing, leaping, and lamenting by torchlight, in
garments that he had never dreamt of, to the
sound of kettle-drums and horns and other instruments
as strange to him as their languages
and manner of singing; all combining, with their
flags and banners, in a general cumulative effect
of inexpressible weirdness, without a single touch
to bring it into relation with ordinary life, except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>the Turks bringing to reason with sticks those
who were really too outrageous even for the occasion.
And so the pilgrims spent the three nights,
on the floor, in as utter disregard of decency
and sanitation, and sometimes of morality, as of
silence.</p>

<p>The descent of the Holy Fire was no more than
an interesting sight to the European tourist;
Roman Catholic and Protestant alike expressed
disbelief in its actuality as openly as the Turk.</p>

<p>On Easter Monday the monks journeyed to
Emmaus, passing the house of Simeon and the
spot where David slew Goliath, returning by
another road past the valley where Joshua
commanded the staying still of the sun, and the
house of Samuel. It was on the Tuesday preceding
the Oriental Easter that the great excursion
of the year took place, to Jordan; the only one in
the year because the danger from the Arabs was
considered prohibitive unless an escort of Turkish
soldiers accompanied the pilgrims, so strong that
only the Easter concourse could pay them. It
was more than a day's journey, so Tuesday night
was spent in the open, starting again however
before dawn at the pace set by the escort's horses;
of the poorer pilgrims who could not afford a
mount, many died either from exhaustion or from
fear. So says Della Valle, and it is confirmed by
Lithgow; the latter, who walked, sometimes was
up to his middle in sand, and "true it is, in all my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>travels, I was never so sore fatigued, nor more
fearfully endangered than that night." At dawn
they arrived where Christ had been baptised, to
see the medley of nationalities, all distinct from
each other in some striking detail or other, once
more in the highest state of excitement; some
drinking, some being baptised by friends, some
dipping their clothes, some renouncing clothes
altogether, scores, perhaps hundreds, of men and
women stark naked, there in the chilly spring
morning, douching themselves till their teeth
chattered and their bodies turned blue, while
others who came to pray remained to laugh.</p>

<p>On the way back some diverged to visit <abbr title="Mount">Mt.</abbr>
Quarantana, the scene of the forty days' fast;
very few ascended it. The way up was a narrow
path along precipices; broken by forty-five steps,
each from five to ten feet high, where there was
little foothold and slipping meant death. This
ended at the little cave where Christ was tempted
by the Devil; the way thence to the summit, from
which Christ had surveyed the kingdoms of the
world, was not attempted by any one: Lithgow
says he reached the top but proves that he did
not; and Della Valle says that the only means of
reaching it was that used by Christ, being carried
up by the Devil.</p>

<p>Easter, too, gave a good opportunity for a visit
to Hebron, for the largest caravan went thither at
that time also. But this was as much a Mohammedan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>pilgrimage as Christian, and Abraham's
house, another of the remarkably well-preserved
buildings of Palestine, was shut against Christians
and Jews. Of these latter there were many who
journeyed to the Holy Land; how many cannot
be guessed, but they certainly outnumbered the
Christians of the West, and equally certainly were
too many to be omitted from a record of Europeans
then, though the only piece of direct evidence
at hand is from the itinerary of one Samuel Jemsel<a name="Anchor-92" id="Anchor-92"></a><a href="#Footnote-92" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 92.">[92]</a>
with whom, in 1641, one hundred sailed in one
ship of the regular fleet from Constantinople to
Egypt, some bound for Jerusalem, some for Safed.
They come into notice chiefly when a caravan is
on the move on their Sabbath, when they remain
behind and make up the lost ground as best they
can.</p>

<p>From other pilgrims they differed in this; the
Christian was leaving home, the Jew was going
home. When they reached Palestine, besides,
some of the spots they visited were famous among
Christians; but mostly they were not. In the best
Jewish guide-book in use in 1600, are mentioned one
hundred and sixty-eight of their famous ancestors
whose tombs were localised. If a Christian visited
Abraham's, his duty to the Old Testament was
done with; and even then he invariably omitted
to observe the stone on which the patriarch sat
when he was circumcised. And as for the tomb
of Adam and Eve, and of Jacob and Leah, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>the prophet Hosea (may his memory be blessed),
and of Isaiah (may Salvation be his), and of
Rachel (with whom be peace), and of the Rabbi
Jeremiah who was buried upright, and, at Ras-ben-Amis,
of the wife of Moses our master, and
of the wife of the high-priest Aaron, and, on <abbr title="Mount">Mt.</abbr>
Ephraim, of Joshua the son of Nun and of Caleb
the son of Jephunneh (may God, in his mercy, be
mindful of them and of all other righteous men)—why,
of all these the Ishmaelites knew nothing, nor
even that at Rama was to be seen the spot where
the Messiah shall appear, nor that there should
be rending of garments when Jerusalem is first
seen and again on reaching the place where once
stood the Temple, now, for our sins, destroyed.</p>

<p>Outside Palestine, too, was much that the uncircumcised
knew not of. He passed through
Cairo without hearing of the copy of the law of
Moses, written by the hand of Esdras the scribe;
though, indeed, no man might see it, not even,
incredible as it may sound, if he offered the keeper
thereof silver (partly because the holy volume
had by now been stolen, and lost, with the thief,
at sea). And Damascus Hebrew and Frank might
equally remember as the city where fresh fruit
was never lacking, but only the former remembered
that hard by Esdras himself lay buried, any
more than the merchant who reached Baghdad
heard that there rested Ananias, Mizael, and
Azarias, and also, with the river flowing over his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>head, Daniel, of glorious memory,—unless the
merchant wished to catch some of the great fish
which swam thereabouts, for fishing was prohibited
at that spot lest harm might befall the
greatest fish of all, Zelach by name, who had
abided there since Daniel's own time and was fed
from the royal table.</p>

<p>And if any of the twentieth-century uncircumcised
hesitate to believe that so much could be
satisfactorily identified, the twentieth-century Hebrew
may answer that there are other tests of
identification than those of the "research" that
has achieved such wonders at Stratford-on-Avon
and that tradition can be traced back, unvarying
even in trifles, for centuries.</p>

<p>He might go on to point out that Christian
tradition might well be more stable. It is curious
how much that is mentioned by fifteenth-century
Christians is habitually omitted by those who
came after. That the taking of Rhodes by the
Turks should cause the disappearance of the
basin in which Christ washed his apostles' feet is
intelligible; but why, e. g., should the table disappear
from Bethany at which the disciples were
sitting when the Holy Ghost descended? And
why should it have dropped out of remembrance
that the torrent of Cedron had been bridged with
stone by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Helen to replace the wooden one
from which the wood for the Cross had been taken
and over which the Queen of Sheba had refused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>to walk, saying in a spirit of prophecy, that the
Saviour of the world was to die on it? It seems as
though there had occurred a diminishment of devotion
resulting in the concentration of what
devotion remained on fewer objects; or else a
widening of interests diverting the attention from
minor objects. Sometimes, of course, transference
took place; which may, or may not, account for
one traveller being shown the pillar of salt which
had once been Lot's wife at a monastery near
Trapani in Sicily in 1639, whereas in 1613 Coryat
was told that she existed on the farther side of
"Lake Asphaltitis with her child in her arms and
a pretty dog, also in salt, by her." Still, no doubt
Giovanni Battista and the warden did their best,
and the latter was willing, in addition, to confer
knighthood of the Holy Sepulchre on all and sundry,
with no questions asked as to lineage, not
even of a Dutchman in the grocery business; and
at least there was the certificate of the pilgrim's
visit to Jerusalem to be received—and paid for.</p>

<p>And now the tourist's last and longest journey
has been told; he is at home safe, leaving us with
nothing fresh to tell except the incidentals of his
journeyings, and leaving us, one tourist, at least,
with his blessing: "In the meantime I leave thee,
gentle reader, travelling towards the heavenly
Jerusalem, where God grant at length we may all
arrive, Jesus Christ being our pilot and Janizary
to conduct us thereunto."</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> is a most unsatisfactory thing—reading
about what you would like to see; but if
seeing sixteenth-century Europe implied
spending the nights in sixteenth-century inns
there is much to be said for preferring the experience
in print only. Luxury of a kind certainly was
to be had. At the "Vasa d'Oro" at Rome were
gorgeous beds, hung with silk and cloth of gold,
worth four to five hundred crowns each; at the
"Ecu" at Châlons silken bedding, too; and Germany
occasionally provided sheets trimmed with
lace four-fingers'-breadth wide in panelled rooms,
while by 1652 Amsterdam possessed a hotel reckoned
the best in Europe, every room in which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>floored with black and white marble and hung
with pictures, with one room containing an organ
and decorated with gilded leather in place of
tapestries. But these superfluities did not imply
that a comfortable medium was easily found. In
any case, accommodation divided itself into bedroom
and dining-room; of anything approaching
a sitting-room there is rarely a word. The chief
exception to this is the five or six halls, decorated
and furnished like those of a rich gentleman, at
the inn outside Sinigaglia. This was the finest
hotel in Italy when built, shortly before 1578, by
the Duke of Urbino, who allowed no other there.
Its forty bedrooms, with no more than two beds
in each, all opened on to one long gallery by
separate doors.<a name="Anchor-93" id="Anchor-93"></a><a href="#Footnote-93" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 93.">[93]</a></p>

<p>The Italian host the traveller would often see
before the inn came in sight; sometimes the latter
would have touts as far away as seven or eight
leagues to buttonhole foreigners, carry their luggage,
promise anything and behave with the utmost
servility—till the morning of departure.
But with all this to expect them to provide clean
sheets was expecting too much, and as the nation
was grievously afflicted with the itch, it was desirable
for the visitor to carry his own bedding.
In many cases, too, we find the tourist sleeping
on a table in his clothes to avoid the dirtiness of
the bed, or the vermin. Still, in Italy, you shared
your bed with these permanent occupants only,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>as a rule; in Spain you were sure to do so; one man,
one bed, was the custom there—a result of the
enforcement of the penalty of burning alive for
sodomy. In Germany the custom was just the
reverse; in fact, if the tourist did not find a companion
for himself, the host chose for him, and his
bedfellow might be a gentleman, or he might be
a carter; all that could safely be prophesied about
him was that he would be drunk when he came to
bed. The bed would be one of several in a room;
the covering a quilt, warm enough to be too warm
for summer, and narrow enough to leave one side
of each person exposed in winter. This is supposing
there were beds: in northern Germany rest for
the night would be on a bench in a "stove," as
they called the room, because the stove was so
invariably part of the furniture that the words
"room" and "stove" became synonymous. Windows
were never opened at night, to retain the
heat in the room; all the travellers lay there, men
and women, gentlemen and "rammish clowns,"
as near the stove as they could manage. The
heat was such that the effect on one unaccustomed
to it was "as if a snake was twining about his
legs." Further, if several met together, says a
Frenchman, one might as well try to sleep in a
market-place on market-day. In upper Germany,
the bedrooms were separate, without fires or the
means of making one, and the change from the
one temperature to the other was very trying.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>As many beds were put in a room as the room
would hold; fairly clean ones, however, as the
Germans treated them with some disinfectant.
In Saxony there were no beds, no benches, no
stove, even. All lay in the straw among the cows,
the chief disadvantage of which was that your
pillow was liable to be eaten in the night. So in
Poland, too, where it meant a cold and dangerous
night, in the country parts, at least, for any one
who did not adapt himself to the custom of the
country by using the long coat lined with wolfskins
which served the Pole as cloak by day and
bedding by night.</p>

<p>As a relief from the general statements, a particular
instance may be quoted to exemplify a
night by the way in Poland. The sleeping-room
struck the writer as something between a stable
and a subterranean furnace. Six soldiers lay on
the ground as if dead; the peasant-tenant, his
wife, children, and servants, lay on benches round
the walls, with coverings of straw and feathers; in
one corner slept a Calvinist, a baron's secretary;
in another, on the peasant's straw pallet, an ambassador's
chaplain, a Roman Catholic; and between
the two, to save each, it seemed, from the
heels of the other, was lying a huge Tartar, a captain
in the Polish army, who had made up a bed of
hay for himself. About the room were dogs, geese,
pigs, fowls; while the corner by the oven was conceded
to a woman who had just given birth to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>child. The baby cried, the mother moaned, the
tired servants and soldiers snored; and early in the
morning the writer rose from the shelf he was sharing
with some leggings, spurs, and muskets, and
escaped.<a name="Anchor-94" id="Anchor-94"></a><a href="#Footnote-94" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 94.">[94]</a></p>

<p>Speaking generally, there were no beds to be
found in the North. In Muscovy everything had
to be carried along; without a hatchet, tinder-box,
and kettle there was no hot food for the
wayfarer till he reached a monastery or a town,
much less shelter; unless by chance he came across
somebody's one-story cabin which would have no
outlet for the smoke except the door, and accommodation
below the level of the average stable,
one room shared between the family, visitors,
and live-stock. When Sir Jerome Horsey was at
Arensberg, in the island of Oesel, near the gulf of
Riga, in 1580, snakes crept about bed and table
and the hens came and pecked at them in the
flour and the milk.</p>

<p>Crossing over to Sweden the absence of inns
was equally noticeable, but no disadvantage, for
one of the conditions on which the parson held his
living was that of showing hospitality to those in
need of it. In Denmark, too, while taverns existed
for supplying victuals, the wayfarer was dependent
on the citizen for lodging, again not to
his loss; he was sure of decent food, a clean bed,
and a welcome. Foreigners in England are singularly
reticent about the inns, except for reviling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>Gravesend for swindling; which may, perhaps,
be taken as confirming Moryson's opinion that
the English inn was the best in Europe. As to
Ireland, there is the usual diversity of opinion;
the absence of inns is accounted for by the traditional
idea that the possession of an inn was a
disgrace to a town, a slur on the hospitality of its
inhabitants; yet the hospitality itself was most
uncertain, since the natives were not in a position
to believe in the neutrality of a visitor.</p>

<p>The <em>personnel</em> question, of course, is one that has
to be allowed for throughout. It was in France
that this method of discounting dissatisfaction
was most in use, but it is in a dialogue printed in
the Low Countries, a conversational guide for
travellers in seven languages, that the following
(an excerpt from the English version) occurs:<a name="Anchor-95" id="Anchor-95"></a><a href="#Footnote-95" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 95.">[95]</a></p>

<p>"My she-friend, is the bed made? is it good?"</p>

<p>"Yea, sir; it is a good feather-bed; the sheets be
very clean."</p>

<p>"Pull off my hosen and warm my bed; draw the
curtains and pin them with a pin. My she-friend,
kiss me once and I shall sleep the better....
I thank you, fair maiden."</p>

<p>The German host was too apt to think that a
heavy meal and honesty were all that could be
expected from him. The honesty was indeed remarkable;
more than one stranger was astonished
by the recovery of property mislaid; sent after
him, sometimes, before he had discovered his loss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>and no reward taken; but it was paid for dearly
indirectly through the insolence born of virtue
in a class that is naturally below the Ten-Commandment
standard. The customer was made to
feel that the favour was to, not from, him. An
exception to this is the experience of Van Buchell,
who found German hosts sending hot water up to
a traveller's bedroom, if it was noticed he was
tired, with herbs in the water, such as camomile,
for strengthening the feet; and this even at Frankfurt
<abbr title="am Main">a/M.</abbr> in Fair-time as well as elsewhere. But
there was no such thing as hastening on, or delaying,
a meal-time, or dissatisfaction with the
food; the bill must be paid without question, not
a farthing abated.</p>

<p>And generally, indeed, the help of the law did
not seem to avail against the innkeeper. Tourists
speak of successful appeals to the law on other
points and curse the inns without ceasing, but a
successful tourist's lawsuit against his host remains
to be found. In Tyrol, in fact, the plaintiff
would find the defendant not only on, but controlling,
the bench; and in Spain most innkeepers
were officers of the "Santa Hermandad," a "Holy
Brotherhood" whose forgotten ideal and raison
d'être was that of acting as country police, with
the result that the complainant would probably
be arrested at the next stopping-place on some
trumped-up charge. Neither was the local authority
of assistance so far as prices were concerned in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>spite of the latter being fixed by it and posted up;
because the local authority was open to bribery,
and the innkeeper had known that as long as he
had been in business. In short, when the bill came
to one hundred per cent too much in Spain, the
cheapest way was to pay it.</p>

<p>Of all the ill-feeling that the tourists harboured
against Spain, the bitterest was on account of the
inns; from the earliest, Andrew Boorde, who says
"hogs shall be under your feet at the table, and
lice in your beds," and another who relates how
he preferred to hire three Moors to hold him in
their arms while he slept. Those who come midway
through the period tell the same tale; at Galleretta,
on the border of Castile, a German finds the
stable, the bedroom, the kitchen, the dining-room,
the pigsty, one and the same room, and a Papal
envoy sleeps on straw one snowy night without a
fire. The latest writes that the sight of the inns
was more than enough. There was but one way to
reconcile one's self to the wayside inn of Spain;
and that was—trying those of Portugal.</p>

<p>Over all these inns the Turkish "khan" had this
advantage, that there was no host. A "khan" was
a building which some compare to a barn, and one
to a tennis-court, with a platform running round
inside the walls about four feet broad and usually
three to four feet high, but sometimes ten. At intervals
of about eight feet were chimneys. The
platform was for the travellers; the inner space for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>their beasts; the chimneys for each party to cook
food at. That was the normal form, seeming to an
uninstructed traveller just a stable, in which idea
he would be confirmed by the scents in the early
morning. The average Christian found that the
noises and the lights prevented sleep, but the Turk
carried a rug to sleep on, used his saddle as a
pillow and his great rain-cloak as a covering and
found it comfortable enough till daybreak, when
he thought it suitable to get up, greatly to the disgust
of the Christians present. Or if the moon was
very bright, he might arise earlier by mistake; for
he carried no watch, nor believed one when he saw
it. Even in the ordinary "khan" there was often a
room over the door to which the traveller might
retire if he chose, but the Turk seldom used this,
preferring to keep an eye on his beasts; and the
Frank consequently might remain unaware that
there existed any escape from the camels. Most
"khans," built of hewn stone roofed with lead,
would accommodate from eighty beasts to one
hundred and fifty; and practically always had
their fountains for the washings prescribed by the
Turks' religion: but as time went on, far more magnificent
places arose, with covered ways leading to
mosques across the road, and many rooms, capable
of holding nearly one thousand travellers and
their belongings. The finest lay along the road
leading from Constantinople to Christendom.
The fact that "khan" is indiscriminately applied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>to all by most Franks is evidence that they were
not on speaking terms with the natives, to whom
many were known as "Imaret," those, that is,
which provided food free. All lodgings were a
form of good works among the richer Turks, a
practical attempt to disarm the customary suspicions
of the Grand Signor or the well-justified
wrath of Allah; and free food was an extension of
this appeal. The food was barley porridge mostly,
or of some other grain, with meat in it; and bread,
and sometimes honey; nor was there any idea of
poverty associated with taking it; Jew and viceroy
alike were recipients. Of all the marvellous provision
for travellers, and even for the care of stray
animals, in Constantinople, free food, free lodging,
free medical attendance for men of all creeds, as
unfolded in detail by the Turk traveller, Awliyáí
Efendí, there is no need to dwell on, since the
Frank knew of its existence but rarely and dimly,
by hearsay only, for he would be lodging over the
water at Pera with his nation's ambassador.</p>

<p>The Turk himself never travelled alone. Had
he done so, he would have found the non-existence
of the innkeeper troublesome. Near Constantinople
there was a "khan" for every stage
of every journey; but not so farther away; from
Aleppo to Damascus was nine days' journey and
only five "khans" on the way. But accompanying
the caravan, he was taken care of; a quadrangle
was formed, the travellers inside, among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>the waggons; the lines of the square formed by the
beasts, their heads tethered inward; and at night-time
was an outer line of fires; by the side of the
fires, the watch; outside the fires, the patrol, until
the three loud strokes on the drum which gave the
signal for starting.</p>

<p>For out-of-door lodging, "at the sign of the
Moon," as their phrase ran, there was much to be
said; but then, how about food? Their guns were
short in range; inaccurate within their range; and
how much ran about that they might not touch on
pain of death. The deer in Germany knew their
immunity so well that they would lie in the road
and have to be persuaded to leave room for the
waggon; and to keep your hand from picking and
stealing was an effective commandment where
an economical duke of Florence lived who had
planted those mulberry trees by the wayside and
looked for profits. And so we return to the inns,
leaving the bedroom to consider the fare.</p>

<p>But first—how to find them? By the sign when
there was one; but supposing there was none? In
most parts of Germany inns were distinguished
solely by the coats of arms which visitors had
put up to commemorate their progresses. The
best inns could show, inside and out, as many as
three hundred or more. For the signs themselves,
it may be interesting to know what were the
commonest signs and what were the exceptions.
Out of a total of three hundred and fifty-eight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>different inns which these travellers mention by
their signs, the "Crown" occurs most frequently
(thirty-two times), mainly as a result of "Ecu de
France" being so favourite a name in France.
"White Horses" and "Golden Lions" seem to
have been about as popular then as now; where
changes have taken place is rather in connection
with ecclesiastical signs. The "Cross" occurs
twenty-two times, eleven of which are "White";
the "Three Kings" (fourteen) and the "Red Hat"
or its equivalents, the "Cardinal's Hat" or the
"Cardinal" (seven), are other examples; but of
saints there are no more than twenty-five altogether,
including five of "Our Lady." Barbara
(three), Magdalen, Christopher, and John are the
only other names that are used more than once.
Among those who have but one of the three hundred
and fifty-eight inns dedicated to him or her, is
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martha, the patroness of those who stay at inns.
The only form that is found coming into fashion
is that of "Town of ——" a fashion set, apparently,
by Paris during the first quarter of the seventeenth
century, to establish a special clientèle:
the "Ville de Brissac," there, for instance, catered
for Protestants, the "Ville de Hambourg" for
Germans. But there existed at many towns inns
which specialized in this way under ordinary
names. At Lübeck were English inns; at Calais
the "Petit <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jean" was a meeting-place for
Scotchmen; and Germans in Italy were directed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>to the "White Lion" and "Black Eagle" at Venice,
the "Two Swords" at Rome, and the "Black
Eagle" at Naples. Signs which occur but once
and have something picturesque about them are
the "Scarlet Siren" ("Serena Ostriata") at Venice,
the "Mille Moyens" at Antwerp, the "Good
Friend" at Leghorn, the "Fish Cart" of Cologne,
the "Bacchus" at Cracow, the "Nereids" at
Noyon; Paris had a "Four Winds" and a "Pineapple,"
Boulogne a "Tin Pot." Neither should
"<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">François de la Grande Barbe</span>" at Agen be
forgotten, if only on account of the host, who
never slept there; every night he was taken away
to prison for debt, says the Pole Gölnitz. It is
curious, too, that in only one case out of so many
should a name come up with any reference to the
heroes of romance ("<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Les Quatre Fils d'Aymon</span>"),
which suggests that the acquaintance with them
was less common among the lower classes than is
generally supposed.</p>

<p>Next, since in nine cases out of ten a sign-board
spells a drink, consider drinks. Spaniards and
Turks drank water; the rest of Europe thought it
unhealthy; in fact, as often as not cleaned their
teeth with wine. Still drinking-fountains were
not unknown; at Paris Zinzerling sampled sixteen.
The consumption of cider, wines, and light beer,
and heavy beer seems to have been localized with
no material difference from to-day. The Turks
alone had coffee and sherbet; and only the Spaniards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>chocolate, drinking which, however, was no
more than a recently introduced fashion for its
supposed medicinal qualities; it was only to be had
where the most expensive kind of business was
done. Among spirits, Irish was reckoned the best
whiskey, but was seldom found outside Ireland,
where it was known as the "King of Spain's
Daughter." In Muscovy aqua-vitæ was the favourite
drink; every meal began and ended with
it; but for quantity consumed hydromel came
first, with mead second. Besides being prepared
plain, hydromel was often to be had made with
water in which cherries, strawberries, mulberries
or raspberries had been soaked for twenty-four
hours or more; if aqua-vitæ had been substituted
for water with the raspberries, the taste is
recommended as marvellous.</p>

<p>For wines, each one was practically confined to
the district that grew it. The export trade seems
to have been for private buyers, little to inns with
the exceptions of Muscovy, where Spanish wine
was well known, of Poland (Spanish and Levant)
and of Venetian territory, in the various parts of
which a considerable variety of wines were grown
and between which there had grown up the habit
of interchange of products which extended to inn-custom.
To be deducted from this is the fact
that Greek wine was the name of a kind cultivated
as much, perhaps more, outside Greece
than within it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>
<p>As to the relative quality of sixteenth-century
wines there are many independent opinions to be
had, and they all agree—Italy was first in that,
too. Among Italian wines, preëminent was the
<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Lagrime di Christo</span> ("tears of Christ"), concerning
which a Dutchman was heard to lament
greatly that Christ had not wept in his country;
what has just been said concerning the localization
of wines should be modified with regard to
this kind which was to be found in many Italian
inns outside its native Liguria. Second may be
counted Montefiascone, with the help, maybe,
of its own particular anecdote, which illustrates
the second-hand character of travellers' information,
since no two versions of the epitaph agree,
and yet most accounts read as if the traveller had
read the original. The tale is of a bishop who
loved wine, was going to Rome, and had a servant
whose taste was to be trusted. The bishop
sent him in advance to test the wine at each inn
and chalk the door-post with "Est" where the
wine was good. When the servant arrived at
Montefiascone he chalked "Est, Est, Est"; and
so thought the bishop, for he drank till he died.
And the servant wrote his epitaph.</p>

<p>Drunkenness was infinitely more common than
to-day, especially in Germany. Laws had, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>true, been passed, more stringent, during the past
century, a result of the victories of the teetotal
Turks; but there was no one to enforce them.
Every German's conversation was punctuated
with "I drink to you" "as regularly as every
psalm ends in a 'Gloria,'" says Moryson, and
among a number of princes whom he saw at a
funeral feast, not one was sober. He queries—what
would they have done at a wedding? adding
that during the year and a half he spent there,
attending churches regularly, he never heard a
clergyman say a word against intemperance. The
national reputation abroad was to match; even,
when once some Germans halted at a village in
Spain, there was a riot; the peasants were really
afraid, beforehand, that the price of wine would
go up!</p>

<p>Turning to meals, we find breakfast less of an
established custom than it is at present. In
France it was more, in Germany less, usual than
elsewhere. In fact, in Germany it was not taken
at the inn, but bought in the shape of "<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">brannt-wein</span>"
and gingerbread at shops, existing partly
for that purpose, at the town gates. French
customs generally were more considerate towards
the new-comer; something to go on with would
often be brought him as he dismounted and water
for a wash, just as in Flanders a bright-faced girl
would frequently be ready at the door with beer
or wine, very ready, too, to drink at his expense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>and to start first; whereas elsewhere he would be
expected to wait till dinner as dusty, inside and
outside, as he came in. A French breakfast consisted
of a glass of wine and just a mouthful of
bread; sometimes, as in Normandy, buttered
toast, sometimes even meat was kept ready; but
the sole instance of a traveller finding himself expected
to eat a substantial meal first thing in the
morning was at the inn of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sebastian, "the best
inn," says Gölnitz, "on the Paris-Lyons road,"
kept by a mother and two daughters. The English
custom of its being taken for granted that the
guest saved some of his supper to serve as breakfast
next morning, does not seem to have been in
use abroad. In Italy it was ordinary to begin the
day at a wine-tavern, where boys waited to serve
cakes as well as wine, on which foundation the
economical Italian would many days last till
supper.</p>

<p>Practically, eating resolved itself into two meals
a day, just what they were used to at home, and
very fortunate it was they were used to it; to us
it seems like alternately starving and over-eating.
In Germany the latter extreme was the more
common; in fact, it is not easy to see how the
second meal was fitted in, considering the time
one took, three to four hours. At Berne there was
a law against sitting at table more than five hours;
at Bâle 10 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. M.</span> to 6 <span class="smcap lowercase">P. M.</span> was the maximum, but
the town council were unable to practise their own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>counsels of perfection and on great occasions finished
in private. In Saxony the innkeeper was
forbidden to serve more than four dishes at a meal;
and there public opinion was perhaps some check,
inasmuch as the common saying was to compare
the Saxon dishes, served as they were, one by one,
to the tyrants of Sicily, each one of whom was a
more fearful monster than his predecessor.</p>

<p>Their neighbours, on the contrary, set all on the
table at once in a two-decker on three iron feet;
in the top story was the inevitable sauerkraut and
beneath, roast meat, poultry, puddings, and whatever
else was to be had; so that an Englishman
likened this two-decker to Noah's ark, as containing
all kinds of creatures. As to these German
"puddings" there is no hard-and-fast rule to be
drawn between them and sausages; and accordingly
one cannot say for sure whether it was pudding
or sausage which was the food Moryson had
for supper one night near Erfurt; but the description
is of no importance compared with the
size, for it was as big as a man's leg, conforming to
the phrase in which the German expressed his
idea of happiness, "<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Lange Würsten, Kurz Predigen</span>"
(long sausages, short sermons). One who
journeyed through Hessen describes his diet as
"mostly coleworts," but a Saxony dinner ordinarily
began with stewed cherries or prunes,
continued with poultry or meat, the pot for
which was set on the fire but once a week; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>concluded with bacon to fill up the corners, as important
a consideration for the host as any one,
for there was no greater reproach to hurl at the
host than "<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ich hab' mich da nicht satt gefressen</span>"
("I didn't eat my belly-full there").</p>

<p>Bacon was of great account in Germany, so
great that the owners were wont to bless their pigs
when the latter trotted out of a morning, to ensure
their safe return; and told off a servant to
wash them as they passed the fountain on their
way back, which they took of their own accord.
But while a well-fattened sow commanded a fancy
price—as much as the equivalent of fifty pounds
was paid at Heidelberg in 1593 for one who had
become unable to eat a whole raw egg at a meal—sucking
pigs were unknown as eatables; an Englishman
who bought one for food was forced to kill
and prepare it himself on account of the unwillingness
of the servants to touch it. What Saxony did
lack was everything that was dependent on the
yield of a cow; throughout Germany there was
little cheese except that made from goat's milk.</p>

<p>A common hors d'œuvre was what were called
"<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Neun Augen</span>"—little lampreys that had nine
eyes. Birds other than poultry were unusual: of
veal and beef there was a moderate supply, of dried
venison rather too much, as was the case at
Hamburg with salmon. Dried fish you might expect,
with many sauces, all designed to create
thirst; fresh fish was expected to be on view alive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>beforehand in the kitchen; no German inn lacked
a wooden fish-tank, kept under lock and key and
supplied with running water. Supposing, however,
that the sauces failed of their effect, the thirst was
sure to come at the end of the meal with the help
of little bits of bread, sprinkled with pepper and
salt. Fruits were preserved habitually; especially
apples and pears, which they halved, dried in the
oven, and served up with cinnamon and butter.
Black cherries they put in a brass pot, mixed with
the best pears cut into small pieces and boiled and
stirred till the contents were thick; then pressure
was applied which sent the juice through holes in
the bottom of the pot; it cooled solid, kept well,
and was in every-day use as sauce for meat after
it had been liquefied again.</p>

<p>Italians had a sauce of their own, according to
Moryson (who has also supplied all the above
German recipes), made of bread steeped in broth,
walnuts, some leaves of marjoram pounded in a
mortar, and gooseberry juice. Much need they
had of a sauce, too, for by the "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">lex Foscarini</span>" it
was forbidden to kill an ox until he was unfit for
work in the fields. It may be suggested that it is
time the "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">lex Foscarini</span>" was repealed. In the
north was plenty of mutton and veal; variety of
fish and poultry, mushrooms, snails, and frogs; in
Tuscany, kid and boar. First and last everywhere
came butter and cheese; everywhere, that is,
where any pretence was made of catering for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>tourists; at Carrara Moryson found the inns only
fit for labourers, and dined on herbs, eggs, and
chestnuts, while Peter Mundy, near Turin, had to
pay the equivalent of six shillings for "an egg and
a frog and bad wine." De Thou, moreover, using a
main road, that from Naples to Rome, became so
done up through the badness of the inns as to seem
to have completed a long and troublesome illness
rather than a journey. But something might be
said for the average Italian inn as seen from the
street. Through the great open windows—really
open, for there was rarely glass in Italian windows
except at Venice—the tables were in view,
always spread with white cloths, strewn with
flowers and fig-leaves and fruits, with glasses set
filled with different coloured wines; during summer,
the glasses would be floating in an earthen
vessel, for coolness.</p>

<p>In France, for some reason, Normandy seems
to have made foreigners more comfortable than
elsewhere, yet Picardy, so little distant, was just
the opposite. Picardy, however, at this time was
stamped with the character of border-country
more disastrously than any other district of
France. Nothing remained, indeed, to the country
as a whole, as regards cooking, but a reputation
for entrées, or, as they were called then, "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">quelques-choses</span>."
"A hard bed and an empty kitchen" was
a common experience in different districts; one
party arrived at Antibes, on the Riviera, in 1606,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>to find one melon constituting all the provisions
of the only inn.</p>

<p>Comparison of the fare in the various countries
of Europe shows no more striking inequalities of
supply than is the case with butter: in Poland so
plentiful as to be used for greasing cart-wheels;
in France so scarce and so bad that English ambassadors
used to import theirs from home; in
Spain still scarcer, except in cow-breeding Estremadura.
A German, when he wanted to buy
butter, was directed to an apothecary, who produced
a little, and that much rancid, preserved in
a she-goat's bladder for use as an ingredient in
salves, telling him there was not such another
quantity in all Castile.</p>

<p>It was not merely on account of the sleeping
accommodation that those who had been to Spain
thanked God for their return and wondered at it.
The wine, they said, was undrinkable, owing to
the flavour imparted to it by the skins that held
it; and as for eatables, all had to be bought separately
by the traveller and cooked by him when
he was tired. A still greater trouble was to find
any to buy. One complains that his stomach
roared for want of victuals and had to be answered
with nothing but roast onions; and so on.
But here again can be traced the effects of their
buying their experience in the north: what the
south thought of the north may be guessed from
the Andalusian hero of a picaresque tale recollecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>how the food of a Catalan acquaintance of his
consisted of hard bread once every three days.
The force of prejudice may be exemplified by a
note or two from the journal of a courtier<a name="Anchor-96" id="Anchor-96"></a><a href="#Footnote-96" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 96.">[96]</a> who
followed after Prince Charles when the latter
went incognito to Madrid. His chief complaints
as to food are: At the first stopping-place past
Santander, whither notice of their coming had
been sent a fortnight earlier, they had a plank
instead of a table, a few eggs, half a kid burnt
black, and no table linen. At a tavern in a wood,
the woman laid a cloth on a stool by way of a
table, and placed two loaves on it while she fried
eggs and bacon for them: enter, from the wood,
two black swine who knock the stool over and
depart with a loaf each. And yet, although he has
noted having enjoyed a good fat turkey at one
place and very good hens at another, when he
lands at Weymouth he says that there was more
meat on the table than he had seen in two hundred
miles riding in Spain.</p>

<p>But even in the north different tales are told
sometimes. Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>, when in exile, writes from
Saragossa,<a name="Anchor-97" id="Anchor-97"></a><a href="#Footnote-97" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 97.">[97]</a> "But I am very much deceived in the
travelling in Spain, for, by all reports, I did expect
ill cheer and worse living, and hitherto we
have found both the beds, and especially the meat
very good.... God keep you, and send you to
eat as good mutton as we have every meal." Lady
Fanshawe is more detailed. "I find it a received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>opinion that Spain affords not food either good
or plentiful; true it is that strangers who have
neither skill to choose, nor money to buy, will
find themselves at a loss: but there is not in the
Christian world better wines than their midland
wines are especially, besides sherry and canary.
Their water tastes like milk; their corn white to a
miracle, and their wheat makes the sweetest and
best bread in the world; bacon beyond belief good;
the Segovia veal much larger and fatter than ours;
mutton most excellent; capons much better than
ours.... They have the best partridges I ever eat,
and the best sausages; and salmons, pikes, and
sea-breams which they send up in pickle to Madrid,
and dolphins, which are excellent meat and carps,
and many other sorts of fish. The cream, called
'nata,' is much sweeter and thicker than any I
ever saw in England; their eggs much exceed ours;
and so all sorts of salads and roots and fruits.
What I most admired are melons, peaches, burgamot
pears, grapes, oranges, lemons, citrons, figs,
pomegranates; besides that I have eaten many
sorts of biscuits, cakes, cheese, and excellent
sweetmeats I have not here mentioned."</p>

<p>Both these quotations, it is true, refer to the
middle of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>England was a land of plenty in these days;
Poland no less so. The sum of the experience of
those who had first-hand means of comparison
suggests that Poland was as great an importer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>luxuries as any country in Europe. Muscovy did
not import, but was well off, nevertheless; plenty of
beef, mutton, pork, and veal, and all the more of
them for foreigners seeing that, with fast-days so
numerous as they were, the natives had become so
used to salt fish that they ate little meat, although
the salt fish, insufficiently salted, was often in a
state like that of the fish which the good angel
provided for Tobit to protect him from a demon,
the scent whereof was so terrible that it drove the
fiend into the uttermost parts of Egypt. In Lent
butter was replaced by caviare. An ambassador's
secretary has a pleasant picture to draw of wayside
fare; when they reached a village, the local
priest would appear with gooseberries, or fish, or a
hen, or some eggs, as a present; was rewarded with
aqua-vitæ, and generally went home drunk.</p>

<p>As for food at sea, on small boats no fires were
allowed. Then you were limited, in the Mediterranean,
to biscuit, onions, garlic, and dried fish.
On the bigger ships there was garlic again, to roast
which and call it "pigeon" was a stock joke with
the Greek sailors. On an Italian ship of nine hundred
tons one traveller fared well: there were two
table-d'hôte rates; he chose the higher one: knife,
spoon, fork, and a glass to himself were provided,
fresh bread for three days after leaving a harbour,
fresh meat at first and afterwards salt meat, and
on fast days, eggs, fish, vegetables, and fruit. An
English idea<a name="Anchor-98" id="Anchor-98"></a><a href="#Footnote-98" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 98.">[98]</a> of victualling a ship included wheat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>rice, currants, sugar, prunes, cinnamon, ginger,
pepper, cloves, oil, old cheese, wine, vinegar, canary
sack, aqua-vitæ, water, lemon juice, biscuit,
oatmeal, bacon, dried neats' tongues, roast beef
preserved in vinegar, and legs of mutton minced
and stewed and packed in butter in earthen pots;
together with a few luxuries, such as marmalade
and almonds.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the food to be met with in Ireland,
concerning which it is enough to quote:<a name="Anchor-99" id="Anchor-99"></a><a href="#Footnote-99" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 99.">[99]</a>
"Your diet shall be more welcome and plentiful
than cleanly and handsome; for although they did
never see you before, they will make you the best
cheer their country yieldeth for two or three days
and take not anything therefor."</p>

<p>Except in Italy, fingers invariably did the work
of forks; and often of knives, too. The French
were the only people who were in the habit of
washing before they sat down to table; but this is
by no means so much to their credit as it seems at
first sight, for it was the result of their getting into
such a state previously as to render them intolerable
even to themselves. Except for the effects of
drunkenness, the Germans appear to have been
the pleasantest table companions, in spite of all
sitting at one round table; or rather, because of it,
for men were the more careful of behaving in a
way to which they would have no objection if
their neighbours imitated it. Moreover Germans
made a practice of having a bath every Saturday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>night. From this common table no one was excluded
in Germany except the hangman, for whose
exclusive use a separate table was reserved. The
rest of the dining-room furniture consisted of a
leather-covered couch for those who were too
drunk to do anything but lie down.</p>

<p>As to plates and vessels, no general statement
would serve, not even for one country, owing to
the rapidity with which the supply of silver increased
during these centuries. In 1517 an Italian<a name="Anchor-100" id="Anchor-100"></a><a href="#Footnote-100" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 100.">[100]</a>
notes of Flanders that all their vessels, of the
church, the kitchen, and the bedroom, were of
English brass, but that statement no one confirms
later. Wood was common in proportion to the unpretentiousness
of the inn; except in Muscovy,
where it was almost invariable through the frequency
and thoroughness of destruction by fires
which caused the use of the most easily replaceable
material; the few silver tankards they possessed
were rendered unattractive by their custom
of cleaning drinking vessels but once a year.</p>

<p>The transition from pewter to silver is most
clearly marked in France. The former was in general
use as late as Montaigne's time; even he, who
owns to making himself in a horrid mess at meal-times,
was glad to escape from its greasiness. By
the middle of the next century an Italian priest
notes that the inn-utensils were mostly of silver,
although the chalices which he was given for mass
were mostly tin; and De Gourville, in his autobiography,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>mentions that, on being asked by the government
for an estimate of the total amount of
silver in France, gave a higher estimate than the
other experts because he based his on what he had
noticed in the course of his frequent journeys
about the provinces, in the middle of the seventeenth
century, how every tavern had spoons and
forks of silver and some a basin and ewer. And as
silver drinking-vessels were common among the
English middle-classes earlier than this, it may be
assumed that inns were so provided, too; in fact, in
England silver was considered somewhat vulgar
for drinking purposes, gentlemen preferring Venetian
glass. The Venetians themselves used glass, as
did other Italians; likewise the French; Germans
drank from pewter or stone, and their plates were
often of wood, when they had any; it would give
an altogether too high idea of sixteenth-century
luxury to imagine that every one was given a plate.
Certainly no one had more than one at a meal,
though there is nothing to show that he might not
turn it over to use the clean side—unless he was
at sea, in which case he would risk being thrown
overboard, because every sailor knew that a plate
upside down signified shipwreck.</p>

<p>Inseparable from the inns are the bathing-places;
in most cases the baths formed part of the
inn premises. At Abano, near Padua, the chief
bathing resort of Italy, were private rooms with a
"guarderobbe"<a name="Anchor-101" id="Anchor-101"></a><a href="#Footnote-101" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 101.">[101]</a> adjoining, through which latter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>a stream of the water could be turned on. Baden
in Switzerland was exceptional in having baths
under public control, for poor as well as for rich,
besides those in private hands. The inn Montaigne
stayed at had eleven kitchens, three hundred persons
were catered for each day, one hundred and
seventy-seven beds made, and every one could
reach his room without passing through any one
else's. His party engaged four rooms, containing
no more than nine beds; two of the rooms had
stoves; and a private bath adjoined. Swiss Baden
possessed sixty baths, German Baden three hundred.
Spa was much visited, but most of the
watering-places have been practically forgotten, so
far as the water is concerned, Pougues-les-Eaux, the
chief centre in France, for instance, and Aachen,
where there existed forty baths outside the town,
although the chief ones were within.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_b_268fp"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_268fp.jpg" width="400" height="574" alt="GERMAN BATHING-PLACES" />
<div class="caption">GERMAN BATHING-PLACES</div>
</div>

<p>The object of the visitors was as much medicinal
nominally and as little so really, as might be
expected. "Many come thither with no disease
but that of love: and many times find remedy."<a name="Anchor-102" id="Anchor-102"></a><a href="#Footnote-102" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 102.">[102]</a>
The conditions seem somewhat free and easy:
in Rome it was customary to go accompanied by
a lady friend in spite of the masseurs being male;
of Plombières Montaigne says that it was reckoned
indecent for men to bathe naked or for
women to wear less than a chemise; from which it
may be gathered what ordinary conditions were.
The bathing there was "mixed," as at the German
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>baths where these restrictions were not in force
and where, consequently, the sight of scores of
young couples and parties, some family parties,
some not, in a state of nature, or very nearly so,
amusing themselves with games played at floating
tables, or without any help at all, excited the
shame, the interest, and the participation of foreigners
from all quarters. Ladies, however, who
needed baths and preferred decency, were provided
for at Swiss Baden, where private baths were
for hire, well lighted by glazed windows, painted,
panelled, and clean, with conveniences for reading.
The building of Turkish baths seemed to Della
Valle to afford more likelihood of a chill than the
Italian; but it was, he says, all one could expect
for the price, which was much lower. How much
lower is not clear, but evidently considerably so,
the result of a difference of habit; in Italy the
poor did not bathe, in Turkey the rich bathed at
home.</p>

<p>Quite apart from bathing customs, however,
the position of the lady traveller must frequently
have been embarrassing. Many a nephew, perhaps,
may disbelieve that they ever did travel in
the days when no hot-water bottles existed; but
that would be a mistake; there is record of at least
two substitutes: (1) a bag of semolina, or millet,
heated, (2) a dog. A more serious objection is
that the privacy of the bedroom was not respected.
Even in France, a murderer was lodged in Gölnitz's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>room for the night together with the six guardians
who were escorting him to the place of trial,
and in Picardy bedrooms were merely partitioned
off; doors and windows lying open all night with
no means of fastening them. But a permanently
open window would have been welcome on occasions;
as when in 1652 Mademoiselle de Montpensier
lodged at an inn in Franche-Comté with
no window at all in her room, and consequently
had to do her hair at the door.</p>

<p>Again, respectable women would not be travelling
alone, and as bedrooms were so few they
would always have to be prepared to share the
room with their escort, even if with no other man,
a condition which persisted up to far more recent
times. In 1762, writes M. Babeau, a lawyer,
travelling through Périgord with a lady client,
her son, and a girl, had to put up at an inn which
owned but two beds and those both in one room.
This room, by the way, possessed two doors, one
opening on a meadow, and with joinery so imperfect
that a dog could have crept in underneath
it; no dog took the chance, it is true, but the wind
did. In the previous century was often reprinted
a "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Traité de la civilité qui se pratique parmi
les honnêtes gens</span>" which established the procedure
to be followed in these embarrassing circumstances.
The escort must allow the lady to
undress and get into bed first, and, for himself,
take care to undress at a distance from her bed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>and remain "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tranquille et paisible</span>" through the
night. In the morning he ought to be well advanced
with his dressing before she awoke. But
this book was evidently unknown to Sterne when
he pursued his "Sentimental Journey," for when
he had to share his room with a lady who was a
total stranger, they drew up a special treaty
which both promised to observe and which each
accused the other of breaking.</p>

<p>Of lodgings and "pensions" and houses for hire,
it is unnecessary to speak, because apart from the
conditions of living that have already been indicated
there is nothing to distinguish them from
those of to-day; "pensions" are doubtless still to
be found in the same variety now as two hundred
and fifty years ago at Blois—"dainty, magnificent,
dirty, pretty fair, and stinking."</p>

<p>Supervision over the inns was far stricter than
at present, especially in Italy. At Lucca and Florence
all the inns were in a single street; and in
many towns the new arrival was taken before the
authorities by the guard at the gates previous to
choosing his inn, to which he would be conducted
by a soldier. At Lucca, too, was a department of
the judiciary, called "della loggia," which was
specially concerned with strangers, and to this
the innkeepers had to send a daily report on each
guest. Yet to judge by the tourists' accounts, the
supervision might well have been carried further
and reports on the innkeepers required from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>tourists. Such a system of double reports would
have been a check on the murdering innkeeper, to
whom there are occasional references; one had
been detected at Poictiers shortly before Lauder's
arrival, and at Stralesund, another's tale runs,
eight hundred (!) persons had disappeared at
one inn. They had reappeared, it is true—pickled.
Another kind of innkeeper who ran less
risk but was equally dangerous was he who was
in league with robbers; it was common enough,
if travellers may be believed, for robbers to have
spies in the inns. At Acciaruolo, near Naples, another
device was practised by the keeper of an
atrocious inn. He had an understanding with the
captains of coasting-vessels, the result of which
was that the latter found it impossible to get any
further that night or to let the passengers sleep in
the boat.</p>


<p class="mt2">It must have occurred to the reader that this
is a most one-sided chapter: the tourist has been
having his say so uninterruptedly that even a
clergyman in the pulpit might envy him. What of
the innkeepers' side of the question? Fortunately
that can be presented, too, with the help of a
manuscript so unique that it must be described
now instead of being buried in the bibliography. It
is nothing less than an account of an Innkeepers'
Congress in 1610, written by a delegate. At least,
an expert palæographer (whose name I am not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>permitted to give for fear of another expert palæographer)
affirms it to be in a fairly recent commercial
script; and it certainly is in English.
Nevertheless, there can be no doubt as to its genuineness.
There is no inn, for example, of the three
hundred and fifty-eight referred to above which
is not mentioned in it; neither is there any inn
that is so mentioned that is not to be found among
the said three hundred and fifty-eight. Subjective
tests, moreover, however dangerous, have their
value, and it will appear that the wealth, and, so
far as it can be checked, the accuracy of detail, the
turns of phrase and of mind, equally characteristic
of the innkeeper and the sixteenth century,
leave no more room for doubt here than, to take
a report of a meeting, in the case of the account
of the sayings and doings of the agriculturists in
session of which Flaubert made such instructive
use in his biography of the late Madame Bovary.</p>

<div class="caption">THE RED GATE, ANTWERP</div>

<p>The congress was held at Rothenburg on the
Tauber, not so very far from Nuremberg, that
town being chosen because no tourist was ever
known to go there, any more then than now; and
consequently none was better adapted to prevent
more than one side of the question being heard,—which,
as every one knows, means life or death
to a congress.</p>

<p>London was represented by Paolo Lucchese, and
four Englishmen were also present, the four who
saw most of foreigners who had been to England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>and of Englishmen who had been abroad: namely,
William Cooke of Douay, the host of the
"Golden Head" at Calais, another of Dieppe
whose name and whose sign are alike illegible, and
lastly the notorious Zacharias of Genoa, who told
how he had been wrecked in West Indian seas
and had swum twenty-two leagues with the ship's
carpenter, pushing the latter's tool-chest before
him, and how the tinder-box which he put in his
hair did not even get wet; all just as he told it to
Evelyn years afterwards, until every one got tired
of him. The only Scot was Miltoun of the "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Croix
de Fer</span>" at Paris (Rue <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin).</p>

<p>From France the delegates were Robert Buquet
of Rouen, Du Peyrat of Loudun, Parracan of
Arles, whose inn had no sign because his wine was
so good that it needed none, Christopher Prezel of
the "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Lion d'Or de la Lanterne</span>" of Lyons—but a
full list is, after all, of no great interest. It is sufficient
to say, to give some idea of the value that
attaches to the report of the proceedings, that almost
every delegate was a host in himself. For the
rest, genealogists in the employ of American millionaires
can have access direct to the manuscript;
such things are best left in private hands.</p>

<p>The ladies, however, must not be omitted. Old
Donna Justina of Venice was there, in spite of its
being as much as thirty years earlier that De Thou
had been recommended to her as the only innkeeper
of the city in whose house none but respectable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>women were to be found. Berenguela de
Rebolledo likewise attended, lady-in-waiting at
an inn at Madrid, cheerful, inquisitive, and a flirt,
just as Pablos de Segovia knew her, with a bit of a
lisp, scared of mice, vain of her hands, and a blush-rose
and gloire-de-Dijon complexion. Then there
was Marie Beltram, who ran the "venta" the
other side of Yrun, and the girl harpist who played
at the inns at Brussels, of whom the appropriate
remark to make was to quote,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
     <div class="verse"><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Haec habiles agili praetentat pollice chordas:</span></div>
     <div class="verse indent2"><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Tam doctas quis non possit amare manus?</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Two elderly parties were likewise present who,
thirty years earlier, had been the two pretty
daughters of the one-eyed host of the "Red Lion"
at Dordrecht, the same host who warned Van
Buchell, the antiquary, when a youngster, against
French girls. They were given, he said, to making
advances; once one kissed him, and for a long
time afterwards he did not think he could live
without her.</p>

<p>But the belle of the congress seems to have
been the daughter of the innkeeper at Bourgoin,
the second post-house this side of Chambéry,
since there is a marginal note against her name,
evidently retained from the original, "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ista capit
biscottum</span>." This confirms the account given of
her by Lord Herbert of Cherbury in his autobiography;
his friends had told him she was the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>beautiful girl they had ever seen, so he rode over
from Lyons to see her, "and after about an hour's
stay departed thence without offering so much as
the least incivility." Finally there was a widow
from Tours; the one from the "Three Kings,"
known as "La Gogueline"; the other widow of
Tours, of the "Three Moors," stayed at home,
fearing to endanger her reputation as the "mother
of the Germans" by so long an absence. Widow
Gogueline, however, told the writer that the other
was better known as their stepmother and that
there was a rhyme which ran:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
     <div class="verse"><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Quand vostre bourse est trop pleine</span></div>
     <div class="verse"><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Allez aux 'Mores' en Touraine:</span></div>
     <div class="verse"><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Je vous jure que vous serez</span></div>
     <div class="verse"><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">En peu de temps en deschargez.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It was taken for granted that the president
must be an Italian; and Francisco Marco of Venice
was chosen for that geniality of his that in
years to come was to charm James Howell. He
opened the proceedings with some graceful presidential
irrelevancies, commenting on the antiquity
and fame of Rothenburg and so forth, and then
explained the purposes of this Innkeepers' Congress
as twofold. Its primary object, he said, was
the advancement of God's glory; secondly, the
furtherance of the interests of innkeepers and
their customers, which, he added, were at bottom
identical. The committee had invited certain of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>the delegates who were especially well acquainted
with foreigners to explain, or refute, what visitors
found objectionable. The assembled innkeepers
could then return able to inform, each one his own
countrymen, before the latter's departure, what
must be looked for in the parts he was travelling
towards, and how unavoidable, and even desirable,
those characteristics were. The president therefore
called upon Messer Bevigliano ("<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Chiavi
d'Oro</span>," Florence) to speak for Italy.</p>

<p>Three things, said Messer Bevigliano, hinder
us Italians from doing our best for the community:
the licensing system, 'tied-houses,' and labour
difficulties. I should be the last to suggest
the abolition of our picturesque custom in use
when an inn is to be let. At the auction a candle is
lighted: the highest bid before the candle goes out
wins the business. But the periods of tenancy, one
and six years, alternately, in Florentine territory,
are inconvenient. Far worse, however, are the
prices extorted, especially from those who keep
inns outside the gates of towns, the use of which
is so necessary to such as are compelled to arrive
late, or wish to leave early. Even apart from
these, the majority pay 100-150 crowns (£150-£225
present value) for their licenses; some 500
or 600. At Venice wine-shops and inns pay 1000
crowns. The proportion this bears to the rent may
be judged from the case of an old widow I know
8 miles from Florence whose rent was 23 crowns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>and whose license was 56. Another inn, kept by
a shoemaker, a freehold house worth 6 crowns a
year, pays 20 crowns for license, while the other
license, for shoemaking, only costs a Giulio and a
half.</p>

<p>What I mean by a 'tied' house is one which
belongs to the owner of a large estate who allows
nothing to be sold there except the produce of
that estate.</p>

<p>Lastly, as to labour, the custom of the country
is against the use of women-servants, against even
the host's wife and daughter assisting him. What,
Messer Bevigliano concluded, apart from ordinary
routine-work, would happen to your Fair at Mülhausen
if there were no girls to serve the drinks?</p>

<p>Next came Francisco Marques of Alicante, well
known to sailors of every nationality. What he
laid most stress on has in the main been anticipated
by Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> and Lady Fanshawe, but he
supplemented it as follows: In the towns clean
and comfortable beds were to be had, with meals
ready. Many <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">posadas</i>, he admitted, provided nothing
but utensils, table-linen, oil, salt, vinegar; yet
travellers were then neither better nor worse
off than in Poland, Bohemia, and Picardy, where
the custom was likewise. As for the wayside inns
which gave nothing but a roof and horse-provender,
they barely existed outside Castile and Aragon,
and there the wayfarer should prepare accordingly,
as the Spaniard did, who journeyed with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>bag full of provisions on each side of the saddle and
a bottle of wine to each bag. As to the supposed
lack of meat, he went on, most Spaniards are vegetarians;
and considering the achievements of the
Spanish infantry, I do not think any one can find
fault with the principle. Neither does this apply
to the lower classes only, for we have a rhyme
which says:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
     <div class="verse"><span xml:lang="es" lang="es">Unas Azeytunas, una Salada, y Revanillos</span></div>
     <div class="verse"><span xml:lang="es" lang="es">Son comida de Caballeros</span>;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>and so far from altering our ways, the ancient
rule that a gentleman who has partaken of onions
shall absent himself from court for eight days has
fallen into abeyance. For those who prefer meat,
there is plenty. Fowls, I know, are scarce, and
you are so used to fowls that you think "no fowls,
no meat"; and yet, I remember when I was a small
boy and Queen Anne arrived at Santander to
marry good King Philip <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>, she was presented there
with two hundred fowls and a calf. As to sheep,
ask the eight Germans who recently ate a whole
one between them; besides, does not the famous
Lazarillo de Tormes tell us that it is the regular
thing at Maqueda to eat sheep's heads on Saturdays
at three maravedis apiece? and on fast days
we have special permission to eat cow-heels and
sucking pigs. Now, how can these things be if we
have no sheep nor cows nor little pigs? On the
contrary, you Germans, who take so well justified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>a pride in your bacon at home, how is it you
say nothing about it after a week or so with us?
Why, we have an author, Lope da Vega Carpio,
who will soon be recognised as the greatest writer
since Seneca, who always takes a rasher of our
bacon before starting to write, as a stimulant!</p>

<p>But I can quote something better than your
own experience—the words of the King and of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael. Charles <abbr title="the fifth">V</abbr> advised the great Alonzo
de Guzman against going to Italy, "Better stay at
home and kill rabbits on your own hills and eat
them than be killed by the sea and be eaten by the
fishes": and when the said Alonzo dreamed that
he was dead, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael appeared and sentenced
him to return to earth for his misdeeds and eat
roast meat and be content; and Alonzo found
himself able to arrange for roast duck in summertime
and an "olla" keeping hot in the chimney in
winter. If I say nothing as to wild boar and partridge,
it is merely because it is getting late. But
I will just add this in confidence, that people, we
find, pay more willingly when the bill is accompanied
by a cheerful "<span xml:lang="es" lang="es">Y haga les buen provecho</span>."</p>

<p>The Muscovy delegate, "Cologne Jimmy" of
Nerva, had drawn the third place; but being temporarily
bereft of his faculties by the number of
drinks new to him, a discussion was substituted
at the instance of M. Petit, who enjoyed most of
the French custom at Rome, on the evil of free
board and lodging which various institutions provided,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>a most demoralising custom and very hard
on those who wished to gain an honest living. At
Seville and Montserrat, he had heard, things had
come to well-to-do people being given fish as well
as bread, and at Amsterdam foundations were
even being instituted on a secular basis. That
they might be in a better position to take action,
it was proposed to form an Innkeepers' Association,
but when an Irish waiter from Madrid suggested
as a motto, "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Pediculus pro comite jucundo,</span>"
recriminations ensued which soon rendered adjournment
necessary.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, at the banquet in the evening all
passed off happily in the traditional way.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="stanza">
     <div class="verse" xml:lang="la" lang="la">In principio est silentium,</div>

     <div class="verse" xml:lang="la" lang="la">Et in fine rumor gentium.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The next day began well too, with the speech
of Jean Busson ("Le Fardeau" Dieppe), who excused
the faults of the French host as attributable
to the civil wars, and said that whether or no religion
was "reformed," cookery certainly was, and
that in future the traditions of Guillot's of Amiens
would be upheld. At the same time he felt he
would be next door to a traitor if he owned to
any serious faults, for supposing that such were
imagined, French chambermaids could be trusted
to keep the visitors happy (great applause). But
he had a proposal to bring forward. He found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>they had a custom in Germany, which was also
used at Bourges, which deserved extension. He
referred to the watchmen who lived at the top
of the town belfry and signalled the approach of
travellers to those below by means of flags; at
Ferrara and Bruges and elsewhere, the signalling
was done with bells. Now this ought to be customary
everywhere, and whereas here in Germany
the watchmen descended at meal-times and made
a collection at the inns, surely the municipal authorities
ought to pay them. A resolution to this
effect was passed unanimously.</p>

<p>The Low Country delegates caused considerable
dissatisfaction by their memorial insisting that
nobody had complaints to make of their inns,
nor would there be any anywhere if pains were
taken to be up-to-date and, above all things,
clean. But their brethren were grateful for the
warning that it was becoming the custom with
travellers to slip leaden bullets into the cheese,
where they found the custom in vogue of charging
for it according to the difference in weight before
and after it was set on the table; and agreed
with them when they pointed out that the system
of putting up a list of things customers might not
do and fining them when these rules were transgressed,
was breaking down. An innkeeper from
Augsburg gave an instance; his request, he said,
not to foul the walls was so far from being heeded
that he kept one man at work cleaning them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>
<p>It was this member from Augsburg who brought
about the unhappy ending of the Congress, for,
in commenting on the Low Countrymen's strictures,
he tactlessly quoted the Italian proverb
"<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Dal hoste nuovo e dalla putana vecchia, Dio ci
guarda</span>," and then went on to lay it down as irrefutable
that nobody grumbled unless he thought
he had been done. This was easily avoided, he
said; treat all alike; no man ever grumbled in Germany
except new-comers and unreasonable people.
Why? because Germans had fixed prices;
the only system which was conformable with
God's law. By this time the interpreters fairly
trembled as they translated, but when, speaking
as he did in Latin, he went on to apply to the system
of variable charges the adjectives that were
in daily use in theological controversy, the others
understood without help and a battle ensued.
First in words, beginning with shouts of "<span xml:lang="es" lang="es">Pese al
diablo</span>," "<span xml:lang="es" lang="es">Voto á Dios</span>," and other Spanish expressions,
of which, together with all the Italian,
not even the initial letters could be printed, answered
with "<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Bey Gott den Herrn</span>," "<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Meine
Seele</span>," "<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Der Teufel hole dich</span>," "<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Gottes Kranckheit</span>,"
without, curiously enough, the use of a single
one of those employed by historical novelists.
To words succeeded blows; and there the Congress
ended.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">What</span> M. Babeau, in his charming "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Les
Voyageurs en France</span>," says of the
history of France since the eleventh
century, that it may be divided into three periods,
of the horse, the carriage, and the railway,
is true of most of Europe. He goes on to point out
that the first period synchronises with the feudal
system, the second with uncontrolled monarchy.
And this was not a matter of chance, for the improvement
in the state of the roads implied by the
substitution of driving for riding directly resulted
from the centralisation of authority. A feudal
system tended to keep the roads bad, partly because
no one authority received such exclusive
and overwhelming benefits from the roads as to
be ready to bear the cost of their upkeep; partly
because the constant petty warfare which feudalism
gave rise to often made neighbours desire
that approaches should be difficult rather than
easy.</p>

<div class="caption">A MAIN ROAD IN ALSACE</div>
</div>

<p>In 1600 the transition was in its infancy; and
even during the subsequent half-century is only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>noticeable in a marked degree in France. Even
there, the change was not from bad roads to good,
but from very bad to a state of uncertainty. One
road, it is true, is mentioned as paved, at any date
during these two centuries, that from Paris to
Orleans, but by Evelyn's time there were many
such in France; while, on the other hand, on the
king's highway between Bourges and Lyons the
horses of Gölnitz and his companions fell into a
marsh, whence they were rescued with difficulty;
and on another highway (Paris-Bordeaux) Claude
Perrault, the architect of the Louvre, speaks of
one occasion when night overtook him before he
had reached his stopping-place; and the holes in
the road being so deep as to render it almost impassable
for his carriage, a quarter of a league
took him four hours to cover.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Europe, things seem to be remaining
much as they had been. Here and there in
Italy sections of Roman road which had been
maintained in fair condition continued to be
patched in imitation of Roman methods until they
appeared excellent in contrast with the others;
what the others were made of travellers do not
say, but it may be guessed that they were paved
like hell in the proverb. Montaigne might note
with sadness how the Via Flaminia had shrunk
from forty feet broad to four between Loreto and
Lucca, although one may query where he found
that it was ever more than fifteen feet across; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>no one else had recourse to archæology to make
himself grieve. The following is a tale that Rivadeneyra,
Loyola's boy-friend and biographer, tells
of some of the other early associates during a walk
from Venice to Rome. Being Lent, they fasted except
for what they received in alms. "And one Sunday
it befell that, having tasted no more than a
few mouthfuls of bread that morning, they trudge
twenty-eight miles of that land on their bare feet;
and all the day the rain comes down pitilessly,
whereby they find the roads turned into lakes,
and that so truly that there are times when the
water reaches their chests." He continues, "None
the less they feel within them a marvellous contentment
and joyousness; and being mindful that
they were enduring these troubles of the flesh for
love of God, gave thanks to Him without ceasing,
singing David's psalms in metre; and even Master
Juan Codurí, who was suffering with the itch in
both of his legs, was no whit the worse for the
trials of this day."</p>

<p>It was always the rain that caused the trouble,
although the state of the roads when dry must have
been fearful for ordinary wet weather to effect so
rapid a deterioration. From Ferrara to Bologna
was reckoned a half-day's journey in summer, a
whole day in winter. And in 1606 an Italian says
of the roads near Strassburg that the mud, stones,
and holes compelled the horses to go single file,
each one stepping in the tracks of the leader; near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>Ypres they found the road often indistinguishable
from the fields, and the mud came up to the
horses' girths.</p>

<p>In dry weather the only complaint is against
loose stones on steep gradients, which latter naturally
occur far more frequently on the old roads
than on modern ones, keeping, as the former do,
to high ground for choice. The fact that by this
means traffic was less at the mercy of floods seems
to be considered reason enough for the habit, but
perhaps it was also found to give greater protection
against highwaymen, who were thereby afforded
fewer opportunities for attacking from higher
ground, and for concealment. One place in particular
where these loose stones formed a serious hindrance
was Scaricalasino, between Bologna and
Florence, so named (<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">scarica l'asino</span> means "unload
the ass") because what with the badness of
the road and the sharpness of the stones the asses
had to be relieved of their burdens at intervals.
So, too, the secretary of a Venetian embassy writes
that between Terni and Assisi the way was so
rough as well as muddy that it cost the party of
forty fourteen hours and the deaths of four horses
to do twenty miles.<a name="Anchor-103" id="Anchor-103"></a><a href="#Footnote-103" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 103.">[103]</a></p>

<p>Another difficulty, sometimes a peril, to be
faced were the fords. On the main road, for example,
from Rome to France, through Florence,
there was the river Paglia to cross, which bounded
Papal territory in that direction. The passage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>still remained a ford, although after rain it would
be impassable for a week at a time. And where,
on the map, north of Venice, you see the Tagliamento
divide into seven branches, there, through
them, lay the road which joined Italy with Germany.
Yet only one branch had a bridge over it,
and the fords through the others were dangerous
enough to keep guides at work. It is not surprising,
then, to find Sir Thomas Browne's son having
to engage two men to walk beside his horse up-stream
to break the force of the current lest it
should carry the horse off his feet, since the river
was the Var, in the Riviera, and across a less important
road.</p>

<p>Sometimes travellers preferred the ford even
where a bridge existed, as did one<a name="Anchor-104" id="Anchor-104"></a><a href="#Footnote-104" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 104.">[104]</a> at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jean de
Maurienne on the post-route from France to Italy
because the bridge was in such disrepair as to be
unsafe. The same traveller crossed by boat at
Otricoli beside the ruins of a Roman bridge which
had once been a link in the Via Flaminia. On the
bridges the same political reasons that kept the
roads difficult had set their mark, accounting as
they do for the number of wooden bridges, easier
to dismantle in case of a raid. The bridges of
Strassburg and Vienna were particularly striking
examples of this; the planks were not even fastened
down; if one end tipped up, a plank was as
likely as not to fall into the river. Neither were
there any rails at the sides. That was not exceptional,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>either, in spite of a bridge being worthy of
remark if broad enough for two carts to pass each
other. But whether it was the initial cheapness,
or the habit of precaution, there they were, in
spite of the cost of their upkeep, thirty thousand
thalers yearly in the case of the one at Yarunov
on the Vistula in the middle of the seventeenth
century, when a thaler was nearly equal to one
pound at present value. Yet the traveller<a name="Anchor-105" id="Anchor-105"></a><a href="#Footnote-105" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 105.">[105]</a> who
reports this says his horse trod a hole in it. And
in Hungary, when Busbecq returned from Turkey
by road, the bridges offered so many traps for
horses that robbers laid in wait under bridges for
their best opportunities.</p>

<p>As for stone bridges, Spain seems to have been
the best off before 1600, but subsequently the improvement
in bridges became very marked, especially
in France. When Zinzerling knew Paris
(1612-16), of its five bridges, only two were of
stone, whereas of the six that Evelyn saw in 1643,
but one was of wood. The only stone bridges in
the empire that are mentioned are those of Schaffhausen,
of Ratisbon, and, over the Moselle, of
Coblentz; while two of the finest west of the
Rhine, those of Avignon and Rouen, were impassable
owing to gaps which no authority saw
its way to repair. But the test of a first-rate
bridge in 1600 was not how much traffic, but how
many houses, it carried. Judged by this standard,
it was agreed that London Bridge was the finest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>with that of Nôtre Dame at Paris second, considering
the latter's houses numbered sixty-eight.
Still, it was with the number of bridges that the
tourist was mainly concerned, in which matter
he would find the Loire the only river across which
passage was fairly easy; the Rhine had no bridge
below Strassburg; the Seine had to be crossed five
times by boat in the first four leagues of road
northwards from Paris; and below Turin there
existed no bridge over the Po except a wooden
one at Ferrara.</p>

<p>Means of conveyance consisted of riding, subdivided
into post-horses and other beasts; by
cart, either the long, heavy waggon employed by
carriers, or those with two big wheels and no more,
which occasioned the traveller fewest shocks; and
lastly, by litter. Coaches, in the sense of vehicles
which are supposed to be comfortable, can hardly
be said to have existed except among private owners,
and even these preferred the litter, especially
in winter. The acme of luxury when on the road
may be represented by Marguerite de Valois' litter
used on her journey to the Netherlands. The lining
was of Spanish velvet, the hangings of silk,
the sides glazed with one hundred and forty panes
of glass, each of which bore a different design.</p>

<p>As for carts, though everywhere one comes
across occasional instances of their use by tourists,
this was far more customary in Germany
than elsewhere; even a knight-errant going to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>seek his fortune, Sir Anthony Sherley, mentions
covering distances in them there without apology.
The German "rollwagen" carried six or eight passengers;
those of the Low Countries as many as
ten, sitting on boards laid across the cart so close
behind one another that they resembled geese
going to the pond. The chief centre for carrier-arrangements
was Augsburg; thence to Venice and
back a waggon went each week; between Augsburg
and Nuremberg daily. In France conveyances
started running more freely as the civil
wars slackened, as, e. g. between Troyes and
Paris in 1598; a reversion to what had been in
force earlier. But in 1584 between Amiens and
Paris, and in 1586 between Rouen and Paris, was
running what was called the "coche royale," which
took passengers.<a name="Anchor-106" id="Anchor-106"></a><a href="#Footnote-106" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 106.">[106]</a> By Zinzerling's time communications
of this kind existed between Paris and
Orleans, and Paris and Rouen, daily; between
Rouen and Dieppe thrice weekly; and between
Rouen and Antwerp.</p>

<p>The disadvantages of waggons were more obvious
in the Low Countries than elsewhere, since
there they never entered towns, depositing the
passenger, heavy luggage and all, outside the
gate; often, too, a change of waggons was obligatory
during the day, whereas an English carter
drove straight on, too long, in fact, for his custom
was to keep on the move from dawn till sunset.
The Dutchman, in addition, was usually drunk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>and drove his mares (always mares) like a madman,
and passengers found it advisable, besides,
to wear spectacles to protect their eyes against
the sand thrown up by the road-menders. All
waggons were provided with awnings, of cloth or
leather.</p>

<p>In Italy and Spain practically all traffic was
four-footed. Post-horses were always for hire in
Italy, with a bit of fur attached to their bridles to
mark their status. The owner gave the hirer a
ticket to show his host at the end of the day's
journey, who would then take care of the horse
until a return fare was forthcoming; no security
was asked. It was a novel experience for most
foreigners to ride one post-horse all day: in England
the stages were ten miles; in France, in the
seventeenth century, four or five, so that a traveller
in a hurry would change horses as many as
eighteen to twenty-two times a day. The reason
for the difference lay in the pace, the standard for
which was much lower in a country like Italy,
where mules and asses were habitually used. In
fact, when the pace was set by the mules, as, for
instance, in the Rome-Naples caravans, all who
accompanied which had to keep together for fear
of robbers, a man might be in the saddle all day
and cover no more than twenty miles. As for
wheeled traffic, it may be imagined from the state
of the roads that the pace often sank to nothing
at all. After several breakdowns, one traveller
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>writes: "Advanced that day as far as the cursed
carriages would give us leave, and the rest of
the day practised Christian patience.... Carts
ought to be put in the Litany."</p>

<p>The above must be understood as leaving Muscovy
out of account, for that was the one country
where the journey itself could, under favourable
circumstances, be continued with comfort. Once
the ground was hard enough for sledges, the traveller
could travel night and day and yet sleep as
long as he felt inclined. Nor did the gain end with
positive comfort and double the available time,
since the diminished strain on the horses enabled
them to go at a greater pace for a longer period.
Twelve leagues without a change of horses and a
hundred leagues in three days represent what was
practicable in the ordinary way amid a Russian
winter; treble what would be reckoned good for
any conveyance elsewhere.</p>


<p class="mt2">In Dante's "Purgatorio" (<abbr title="2">II</abbr>, 11-12) is a comparison
well commented on, unconsciously, in
these travel-books. It is when he speaks of himself
wandering</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
     <div class="verse"><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Come gente che pensa a suo cammino,</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Three hundred years later, sign-posts were still as
rare as unicorn-horns. One mile north of Rimini,
where the road forked, stood a chapel between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>two turnings, on one side of it written, "La Strada
di Ravenna," on the other, "La Strada di Bologna";
and the roads round Freiburg were planted
with trees to mark the way, for the benefit of citizens,
however, rather than of strangers, because
of the mouths of the silver mines which would
otherwise have been man-traps. Something of
the kind, too, was put up in Holland when snow
hid the roads. More to the point will it be to
quote John Smith's account of his escape from
Tartary, and how he found pictorial sign-posts at
cross-roads, the way to Christian Muscovy being
indicated by the sign of the Cross; to Crim Tartary
by a half-moon; while a black man with
white spots meant Persia; a sun, China; and minor
princes' territories were pointed out by the emblems
they had adopted. But these were really
out of Europe and those of Freiburg and Holland
outlined the road rather than indicated directions,
as did the poles erected on the Col di Tenda
Alpine-pass for a mile together, each pole a spear's
length from the next. The Simplon and <abbr title="Mount">Mt.</abbr> Cenis
passes were thus marked out also—when the
poles had not been blown flat by the wind.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_b_294fp"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_294fp.jpg" width="400" height="428" alt="A SIGN-POST" />
<div class="caption">A SIGN-POST</div>
</div>

<p>But then, crossing the Alps alone was practically
unknown, although only on the <abbr title="Mount">Mt.</abbr> Cenis
route were professional guides employed as a
matter of course. These guides had their own
special name, "marrons" and a special function,
to "ramasser" the traveller on his way to France,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>down the slope between the summit of the pass
and Lanslebourg, when it was covered with frozen
snow. The traveller took his seat in a rush-seated
chair on runners; one "marron" in front and
one behind. The one in front had a strap round
his chest fastened to the chair; he took a few
steps, and the chair did the rest; if the direction
became amiss or the pace too furious, the "marron"
behind the chair guided or checked it with
an alpenstock. The distance was a league; the
time fifteen minutes. Going towards Italy you
would have found fifty or sixty persons coming to
meet you at Lanslebourg, hat in hand, offering
their services as "marrons" or as horse-owners.
Dismounting, one would have held the bridle, one
the stirrup, one yourself. Two or three struggle
for the privilege of taking your horse to the stable
and your trunk to your room, but the latter privilege
is not one to be granted lightly; it was not in
sound only that "marron" resembled "larron."
The traveller's own horse was sent on after being
shod with calkins, and he himself followed in one
of the sledges, used in ascents, litter-fashion, by
four "marrons," who carried it, two at a time, turn
and turn about; glasses to protect the eyes from
the snow-light formed part of the stock-in-trade
of the local pedlars.</p>

<p>At the top would be found "La Chapelle des
Transis," the wayfarers' mortuary, not empty
probably; in March 1578 it contained fifteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>bodies.<a name="Anchor-107" id="Anchor-107"></a><a href="#Footnote-107" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 107.">[107]</a> After heavy snowfalls the monks of the
neighbouring hospice of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicolas used to send
out search parties; corpses discovered were examined
for proofs of orthodoxy, beads, for instance,
failing which the bodies were left to the
beasts of prey.</p>

<p>During this period the <abbr title="Mount">Mt.</abbr> Cenis route came
to be used more exclusively for passing between
France and Italy than had previously been the
case, doubtless as a result of the transference of
the capital of Savoy from Chambéry to Turin in
1559, between which towns this route was the
most direct. Yet notwithstanding that travellers
note here, and here alone, that the population on
either side of the pass had no other means of livelihood
than by ministering to travellers, the most
frequented route must be considered the Brenner.
It was the only one which wheeled traffic could
pass, though even there the waggon had to be
kept from falling off the road "by force of men's
shoulders," according to Moryson.</p>

<p>Of the experiences to be met with in crossing
an Alpine pass other than the Brenner, there is no
better account than that which the Infanta Clara
Eugenia wrote home concerning the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gothard.
Even before reaching Bellinzona the luggage carts
had to be exchanged for mules. And at Bellinzona,
too, she notes that there was not a woman
without an enormous goitre; and, indeed, the frequency
with which travellers remark on the number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>of those afflicted in this way leaves no doubt
but that the disease was far more prevalent then
than now. It was generally accepted that the
cause lay in the water, but one old resident, at
least, disbelieved this, since he had one himself,
although, as he told a tourist, he had never drunk
water in his life. The worst of the Infanta's journey
occupied the four days after leaving Bellinzona;
the way so narrow that a horse could scarcely
walk and the litters had continually to be taken
off the mules and transferred to men. This narrow
path, of course, lay always with the mountain-side
high above it and a precipice and a river
below. The ladies' litters were by no means according
to royal standards; just four poles and a
linen seat, from which the royal legs dangled; but
she rode most of the way, feeling no fear of anything
but the "snow-bridges," two of which had
to be crossed. On the farther side there was the
"Devil's Bridge" to pass also, or, as she names it,
"Hell Bridge"; which now does not even exist;
twenty paces long above the Reuss, so far above
that the river was out of sight, although the rush
of it resounded so loudly that she could not hear
herself speak. The whole road had been specially
prepared for her passage, and among the preparations
was the erecting of railings along "Hell
Bridge"; in the ordinary way there were none,
the wind being so strong in the narrow gorge as
always to sweep them away very soon. He who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>passed by the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gothard under ordinary conditions,
and the Furka, too, wore gloves and boots
studded with nails to preserve his hold; and the
average Alpine bridge answered to the description
which Cellini gives of those he found on the Simplon
route, a few tree-trunks laid down. Another
Italian going home that way says the last bridge
was thirty feet by two and bent in the middle; he
crossed it at night, coming as it did among the
"last four leagues"(?) between the summit and
Domodossola, all of which he and his traversed in
pitch-darkness among precipices, the foremost
calling at intervals "Ave Maria" and the hindmost
answering "Gratiâ plena."</p>

<p>Most travellers rode horses or mules where they
could, and led, or crawled with them, the rest of
the way; but sledges were also in use, in which
case, Moryson was told, "it sometimes happens
the sledge whereon the passenger sits is cast out
of the way and hangs down in a most deep valley
with the passenger's head downward. Woe be
to him, then, if he let his hold go, or the harness
tying the sledge to the horse should break." Moryson
himself had only passed by the Bernina and
the Brenner, the former of which seems to have
ranked third in order of popularity in spite of
the track being no more than a yard wide in
places. The Splügen was used as often, perhaps,
but when the two <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bernards and the Gemmi
have been added to the list, there is an end of those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>frequented by tourists. One used the San Marco
and Sir Henry Wotton another, which cannot now
be identified, when the ordinary ones were shut
against him by plague. But for an instance of
some one keeping to the coast between France
and Italy, it seems necessary to go back to Beatis
in 1518, a man whose narrative is obviously trustworthy;
yet, after mentioning that it was so dangerous
that few rode, he adds what may sound incredible
except in his own words. "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Ben vero che
questo Camino è di sorte Che in tale giornata di
<abbr title="15">XV</abbr> miglia solamente le bestie se besognarno ferrare
quactro et cinque volte.</span>" For all practical
purposes, moreover, the mountains near Grenoble
must be considered as part of the Alps, lying, as
they did, across the route of all who crossed <abbr title="Mount">Mt.</abbr>
Cenis, and being no less fearful than any of the
Alpine passes themselves. At one point, nearest
Aiguebelette, horses and mules were specially
trained for the ascent and descent, holes having
been cut in the rock which made the way more
practicable for animals accustomed to them, but
almost impossible to any others, unless riderless.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, wherever mountains have to be traversed,
similar conditions prevailed. Near Spalato,
it is true, the path was railed in some distance, the
only railings of the kind in Europe, apparently;
but near <abbr title="Mount">Mt.</abbr> Olympus one looked over the edge
of the precipice he had to ride along and saw
carcasses of horses, caught as they fell, or fallen, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>warn him to be careful. Says one who knew both,
the road over Pen-maen-mawr in these days was
more fearful than any Alpine way. As for Spain,
there were quite a number of main roads which
allowed nothing more than single file here and
there: the pass into Castile on the road from Bayonne,
for instance, and another between Granada
and Cartagena, on entering which it was customary
for travellers to tighten their belts and say
an "Ave Maria" for those who had lost their
lives thereabouts. Above San Sebastian ten men
might hold the road against an army and no beasts
but mules could be trusted on it, nor on the pass
from France into Aragon, so steep that no man was
safe there; while south of Santander, according to
Sir Richard Wynn, for two leagues the road was
two feet broad and one hundred perpendicular
fathoms above the river.</p>

<p>Neither were the efforts thus entailed brightened
by the idea of mountaineering as a form of
pleasure. Probably the only recorded climb undertaken
during this period with no other object
than that of getting to the top is the ascent of "Les
Jumelles," the highest peak near Pau, an ascent
known to us through De Thou. One M. de Candale
started at four o'clock one May morning in the
first half of the sixteenth century. Before half-way
was reached, his younger companions were on
the way down; they had come in their shirts and
found the cold too much for them; M. de Candale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>was wearing a fur coat. At half-way the last trace
of a human being was left behind, but he and some
peasants reached the top with the help of ladders
and grappling-irons and took measurements. It
is characteristic enough of the age that De Thou's
comments on the calculated height are a comparison
with the reckonings of Apuleius and Plutarch
concerning Olympus, which they considered the
highest mountain in the world. Mediæval opinion
put <abbr title="Mount">Mt.</abbr> Sinai first, probably because that was
the only mountain a mediæval Christian ever
tried to get to the top of, a process of reasoning
which may be traced in the guesses of these travellers,
and in local opinion, as to which was the
highest of the Alps; it is always one of those
past which they endeavoured to make their way,
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gothard or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bernard, for which they claim
preëminence. Another fashion of reckoning is to
calculate, not perpendicularly, but according to
the apparent length of the way, which makes <abbr title="Mount">Mt.</abbr>
Quarantana "six miles high"; while one traveller
has a unit of measurement entirely his own, a
mountain being to him so many "towers" high,
the tower in question being the belfry of Malines,
his native place.</p>

<p>There was, nevertheless, one piece of mountaineering
that was continually being done under
the guise of a pilgrimage, the ascent of the Roche
Melon, near <abbr title="Mount">Mt.</abbr> Cenis, or, as it is termed in full
as late as 1574,<a name="Anchor-108" id="Anchor-108"></a><a href="#Footnote-108" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 108.">[108]</a> Roche Rommelon; the Latin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>name had been Mons Romuleus. Of the origin
of this pilgrimage and the reason for building a
chapel to Our Lady on the summit, nothing has
been ascertained beyond what may be read to-day
in the cathedral at Susa, where is still to be seen,<a name="Anchor-109" id="Anchor-109"></a><a href="#Footnote-109" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 109.">[109]</a>
though unmentioned by Baedeker, a triptych representing
a Madonna and Child, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George,
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James, and a kneeling warrior, with an inscription
to the effect that one Bonifacio Rotario of
Asti "brought me [<i>i. e.</i> the triptych] hither in honour
of our Blessed Lord and our Lady on September
1, 1358." The word "hither" refers to the
summit of this Roche Melon, to which the picture
is still carried up every year.<a name="Anchor-110" id="Anchor-110"></a><a href="#Footnote-110" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 110.">[110]</a> In 1588 Villamont
made the ascent, which was only practicable in
August, with spikes on his feet and hooks fastened
to his hands, and rather more assistance than a
modern mountaineer would consider dignified.
The feat is the more remarkable inasmuch as the
height (11,605 feet) is more than half as high again
as the highest point of any pass that was used
then.</p>

<p>On reaching the top, Villamont forgot all his
terror and fatigue in the glorious view, glorious
not for the grandeur of the scenery to him, but because
it was his first sight of Italy, "the paradise
to gain which they willingly," as another phrases
it, "passed through the purgatory of the Alps."
Such was their opinion of Switzerland. They
spoke of the Alps just as we do of the Channel—they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>had had a "good crossing," or the reverse.
More definitely, to quote Howell's words, "the
high and hideous Alps ... those uncouth, huge,
monstrous, Excrescences of Nature," productive
of nothing useful. Few were those who were free-spirited
enough to enjoy themselves. Of the exceptions
most notable are Tasso and the Infanta.
The former mentions the existence of a common
preference for scenes characterised by unbroken
spaciousness, but for himself, he likes a varied
view with much to catch the eye, hills, dales, and
trees, and even, he goes on, "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">E, che più, la sterilità
e rigidezza dell' Alpi, facendone paragone alla vaghezza
degli altri spettacoli, suole molte fiate riuscire
piacevolissima.</span>"<a name="Anchor-111" id="Anchor-111"></a><a href="#Footnote-111" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 111.">[111]</a> The Infanta's own words
are still more remarkable: "<span xml:lang="es" lang="es">Yo dudo que se pudiera
ver mejor cosa en el mundo ni màs para ver.</span>"
Even she, however, when going into detail, gives
first places to the plants that were new to her and
to the waterfalls. When, indeed, somebody else
expresses any degree of pleasure in connection
with the Alps, it is generally the waterfalls that
occasion it. But there is a further exception even
to this, and he, curiously enough, is a popular Parisian
poet, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Amant. Although he writes, in his
"Polonaise," concerning Poland,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>These three have been entirely overlooked
hitherto; the only person of this period whom the
modern mountaineer is told to claim as his spiritual
brother is the botanist Conrad Gesner; but
in claiming him they claim too much—for themselves.
It is true that Gesner does write<a name="Anchor-113" id="Anchor-113"></a><a href="#Footnote-113" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 113.">[113]</a> that he
never lets a year go by without climbing one or
more of the Alps for exercise and pleasure as well
as for botany; and that "whoever does not consider
towering mountains preëminently worthy
of more than ordinary attention is, to my mind,
an enemy of Nature." But he goes on to show
that the Alps meant far more to him than this
much would prove. He looked on them as an
epitome of all Nature's habits and experiments,
the key to all Nature's secrets, to geology in the
fullest sense of the word, structural, historical,
dynamical; and that to a greater extent than is
apparent at first sight, inasmuch as problems now
treated as solved then belonged to dreamland and
problems which seemed soluble there if anywhere
are now known to be better studied elsewhere;
the internal temperature of the earth, for instance,
since it was not recognized in Gesner's day that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>there was any difference in kind between mountains
and volcanoes.</p>

<p>The attitude of the average man of Gesner's
time towards the Alps, however, is but the most
striking instance of a general attitude towards
Nature which circumstances at that time enforced
and which different circumstances have since
abolished. Further, of all classes of men, it was
the tourists who were most oppressed by the circumstances
of the past, and it is the tourists who
get the greatest benefits from the changed circumstances
of to-day. Further still, the difference was,
and is, most noticeable by the tourist when on the
road. In other words, the absence of enjoyment
of the sterner aspects of Nature was the result of
their having far more of Nature than an average
man can stand. The growth of the size of towns
has, so to speak, set a premium on Nature, just
as it has, during the past century, created the
custom of taking annual holidays; while the successive
minimising of the dangers, the discomforts,
and of so many of the lesser difficulties of
travel has provided the traveller with contrast
where once upon a time was none, and leaves him
free to find pleasure (sometimes, perhaps, forces
him to look for it to avoid being bored), where in
1600 all spelt pain and foreboding. This difference
of sentiment culminated then, as it culminates
now, when the tourist found himself among
the Alps. There, above other places, were his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>faculties narrowed by fear and what remained of
them wholly concentrated on self-preservation,
until enjoyment was out of the question.</p>

<p>As to the change of attitude, it is usually credited
to Rousseau, but was in progress before his
influence began to be felt;<a name="Anchor-114" id="Anchor-114"></a><a href="#Footnote-114" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 114.">[114]</a> and if the subsequent
development of the idea is considered, the credit
must surely be shared by Napoleon, as to whose
greatness there is no more conclusive evidence
than that of his Alpine roads. Before these were
carried out, men considered themselves at the
mercy of the Alps; he first, and he alone, put the
Alps at the service of men, and in so doing set
free men's sense of beauty when in their midst.</p>

<p>But here, as always when writing about the
prevalence or absence of a point of view, some
reminder should be added as to the effect of literary
conventions in exaggerating both the one
and the other; that is to say, that in the former
case it will frequently be expressed when it is little
felt, and in the latter it will frequently be felt
when not expressed. Even as to that binding of
the faculties just alluded to, there is the very definite
exception of the Infanta, who was not too
preoccupied to ask questions, thereby learning
that that peak had not been bare of snow for four
hundred years and that this pinnacle was solid
emerald; being considered inaccessible, cannon
had not long before been brought up to shoot bits
off, but without success.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>
<p>Nevertheless, their turn of mind as regards Nature
in general needs some other illustration than
from negative evidence alone, or, among positive
evidence, from so exceptional a feature as mountain
scenery. This may be best taken from their
use of the word "desert." A typical instance is in
a sentence from Peter Mundy, "the way being
faire and plaine, though desert and full of woods."
Six times in "As You Like It" is the forest of
Arden termed a desert:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
     <div class="verse indent6">... this desert inaccessible</div>
     <div class="verse">Under the shade of melancholy boughs.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"Desert" to them meant deserted by men, and
through forests they passed, as often as not, sword
in hand. To quote <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Amant's "Polonaise"
again:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>And yet, if a journey was a "fragment of hell,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>it is comforting to meet some very merry devils by
the way. Quevedo,<a name="Anchor-115" id="Anchor-115"></a><a href="#Footnote-115" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 115.">[115]</a> for one, took his troubles
lightly. Getting out of a bed in which his legs had
been hanging over the end, he and three others
left Linares for Condado in a conveyance drawn
by ten mules. The road, he says, might have been
the road to salvation, so narrow was it, so full of
troubles, a purgatory in little. One hill seemed to
be reserved for mule-hunting when the carriage
had stuck in the mud.</p>

<p>It was February, too; February at its worst.
On smaller provocation men have retired to madhouses.
It seemed like sleeping in the coach; those
who tried to walk pulled their legs out from where
they had planted them without hose or shoes; one
called out, "You down there, who's pulling off my
boots?" After playing at dying for four hours, men
arrived to release them from imprisonment, except
one whose litter had given way and who was too
full of bruises to move, and a clergyman who was
missing altogether, the latest news of whom is that
men were going round about the marshes calling
out his name.</p>

<p>Dallam, too, has a tale to tell. His companions
and himself, passing through Thrace, took a house
to spend the night in, a two-roomed house, one
room above the other. The lower was used as a
cellar; a ladder outside led up to a balcony, the
balcony to a door, the door to their sleeping room,
which was lighted by one small hole. Now, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>evening they had gone for a walk and seen "divers
sorts of vermin of which we have not the like in
England," and, remembering that they had nothing
but boards to lie on, gathered plenty of a
thick soft moss for pillows. But half an hour after
laying their heads down, they discovered that
these pillows harboured one more sort of vermin
"the which did bite far worse than fleas," with the
result that even when the pillows had been thrown
away and the room swept, still they couldn't go
to sleep. So Mr. Glover (afterwards Sir Thomas
Glover), who had dwelt long in the country, told
them stories about the native vermin, "snakes,
adders, and sarpentes." Gradually some dropped
off to sleep; the others ceased talking. But one
Mr. Baylye had occasion to leave the room; the
door was narrow, the wind strong; "so that when
he came into the gallery, the wind blew the garter
round about his leg; it was a great silk garter and
by the force of the wind it fettered his legs both
fast together. Our talk a little before of adders,
snakes, and sarpentes was yet in his remembrance
and the place near where much vermin was. He
thought they swarmed about him, but about his
legs he thought he was sure of a sarpente, so that,
suddenly, he cried out with all the voice he had,
'A sarpente, a sarpente, a sarpente,' and was so
frighted he could not find the door to get in, but
made a great bustling and noise in the gallery.
We that were in the house did think that he said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>'Assaulted, assaulted,' for before night we doubted
that some treachery would happen unto us in that
town. There was fifteen of us in the room—and
it was but a little room. Every man took his
sword in his hand, one ready to spoil another, not
any one knowing the cause. One that could not
find his sword, got to the chimney and trying to
climb up, down fell a part of the chimney on his
head; another that was suddenly awakened, struck
about him with his sword and beat down the shelf
and broke the pitchers and platters which stood
thereon, the room being very dark, for it was
about midnight. Our Janizary, who should have
been our guard and have protected us from all
dangers, took up a loose board whereon he lay,
and slipped down into the vault. As we were all
thus amazed, at the last Mr. Baylye found the
way in at the door. When Mr. Glover saw him,
he said, 'How now, man, what is the matter, who
do you see?' Mr. Baylye was even breathless
with fear, crying out and struggling to get in at
the door; at last he said, 'A sarpente, a sarpente,'
troubled him. When Mr. Glover heard him say
so, he went to the door, and there he found Mr.
Baylye's garter ready to be carried away with the
wind."</p>

<p>Another who was more frightened than hurt
was the Jesuit Possevino, on his way to Muscovy.
Tired out with a day on the main road thither
from Poland, spent handling the axe to clear the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>road of vegetation, dragging the waggons by hand,
sometimes carrying them on their shoulders, he
and his lay down to sleep (in the rain) and were
kept awake by Cossacks in among the trees imitating
the sounds of wild beasts to terrify them.
Pleasanter was it for those in Hungary, where the
custom was, when strangers came in sight, to bake
some bread fresh in the cinders that served as
ovens, and send it to their lodgings by the youngest
and prettiest girls, who gathered themselves
into a ring and danced round the visitors singing.</p>

<p>Yet another picture is of a Frenchman whose
way lay through the Ardennes in time of war; he
was journeying on business. Tales were plentiful
of bands of peasants in the forests, killing
passers-by without distinction. One evening he
makes his escape from four men, takes a by-road
where the highroad was in particularly bad repute;
snow begins to fall, the wind is dead against
him; his by-road leads him cross-country, which
founders his horse; he sits down on a tree-trunk,
back to the wind, and thinks how his brother and
four sisters are providing him with nephews and
nieces who will never give a guess at the troubles
he has gone through in making a fortune, but
will take it for granted that they are to have a
share of it. The nephews, perhaps, would have
told him that it was lucky for him he was in the
Ardennes and not outside <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Malo at so late
an hour, with the twelve or twenty-four, whichever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>it was,<a name="Anchor-116" id="Anchor-116"></a><a href="#Footnote-116" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 116.">[116]</a> savage English dogs waiting for him,
who were sent out every night with their keeper
to guard the town, "killing and tearing any living
creature they encounter withal." In 1627 a man
did die so. Even without the dogs, at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Malo
or anywhere else, it was troublesome, or worse, to
arrive late. Gates were closed, and kept closed,
and this applied, of course, to seafarers as well;
one tourist making for Monaco, another for Genoa,
had for that reason to sleep out in an open boat.
In towns where a strict "Reformed" sect had
the upper hand, this waiting might have to be
done in daytime also; gates as well as shops being
shut during sermon-time. But even supposing he
found means to enter at night, it might be wiser
not to take the offer, seeing that he would find
himself wandering about in a pitch-dark maze of
dirty alleys during the hours when it was permissible
for the inhabitants to throw "slops" out of
window.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="8">VIII</abbr><br />

<small>THE PURSE</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A traveller! by my faith, you have great reason to be sad: I
fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's.</p>

<p class="right">
<cite>As You Like It</cite> (about 1599).</p></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> cost of travelling divides itself into
two kinds; direct and indirect: that is,
into the outlay which the traveller must
reckon on and that which he has to reckon with.
The first kind, the necessities, consists of fares,
food, lodging, passports, tolls, etc., together with
loss by exchange of money or by charges on remittances.
The second kind, the possibilities, includes
loss by robbery, by war, by disease, lack
of legal privileges, ignorance of local custom, and
such like eventualities in so far as any one was liable
to suffer from them through being a stranger
in a strange land.</p>

<p>But before considering the most elementary
necessaries, some working arrangement must be
established about translating payments into terms
of English money of the present day. In the first
place, between 1542 and 1642 money fell from
about nine times its present value to about five
times. Dates must therefore be found within
which the multiplication figure must become
successively nine, eight, seven, six. Suppose the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>first figure be taken up to 1556, when the States
General met at Brussels to deal with Philip <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>'s
debt; the second figure thence to 1589, the year
when the failure of the Spanish Armada began to
tell on economics; seven from 1589 to 1612, at
which date the bankruptcy of the Welser firm affected
all Europe; and six thenceforward. If these
are reasonable fictions, it is the utmost that can
be achieved; in so far as they are not, the definiteness
of the system makes correction of it easier.
Amounts arrived at by these reckonings are given
in square brackets. Usually, however, the original
amounts have first to be translated out of continental
coinage into contemporary English, a process
which involves a series of comparisons too
long to be tabulated here, and often, even then,
needing modification as a result of the context in
which the particular statement occurs. This is
mentioned only as indicating a fresh source of
uncertainty, and possibly of error. A third factor
in these amounts as here given is as reliable as the
two former factors are unreliable; every original
amount represents an actual transaction by a
traveller between 1542 and 1642, except where
otherwise stated.</p>

<p>Necessities and possibilities are sometimes
found considered jointly in general estimates.
Sir Philip Sidney considered his brother should
have two hundred pounds a year allowed him for
travelling. This was in 1578, and he would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>reckoning according to the highest standard that
a young Englishman would have a use for.</p>

<p>Dallington, a guide-book writer, speaking for
Englishmen in France in 1598, estimates eighty
pounds a year; if one servant is taken and riding-lessons
required, one hundred and fifty pounds;
over two hundred pounds is excessive; while another,
Cleland, in his "Institution of a Young
Nobleman" (1607) considers two hundred pounds
a year enough for four persons. Howell (1642)
says three hundred pounds for the youngster at
Paris, with fifty pounds each in addition for a
cook, a valet, and a page; but then Howell had
acted as tutor and no doubt hoped to do so again
as soon as he could get free from the Fleet Prison,
where he lay when his pamphlet was published.
Under these circumstances he was likely to be
considering his own pocket rather than the father's.
Nevertheless, two of the brothers Coligny
[Henri <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>'s courtiers], when planning a year's
tour through Italy in 1546, were said to have
put aside fourteen thousand scudi [£30,000] for
expenses; which annoyed their uncle.<a name="Anchor-117" id="Anchor-117"></a><a href="#Footnote-117" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 117.">[117]</a> But within
a year or two of this estimate, Evelyn was travelling
farther afield than Paris,—he stayed seven
months in Rome alone,—keeping one servant
throughout, sometimes two, learning under several
masters, and making costly and extensive
purchases, on less than three hundred pounds
annually. Of Sir Richard Fanshawe, again, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>wife records that "during some years of travel"
(less than seven, for certain) "he had spent a considerable
part of his stock"; this stock consisted
of what his parents had bequeathed him, fifteen
hundred pounds, and fifty pounds a year: his
travel lay mainly in France and Spain previous
to 1630.</p>

<p>Fynes Moryson, too, gives his expenditure as
from fifty to sixty pounds a year, which included
the cost of two journeys, one in spring, one in
autumn. He was accustomed to the best standard
of living at home, but his income was hardly adequate
to his social position and by temperament
he was a temperate and adaptable man; more
so, to say the least, than the son of Davison,
the Secretary of State whom Queen Elizabeth
made the scapegoat for the death of Queen Mary
Stewart.</p>

<p>Father Davison had been told that one hundred
marks would suffice for his boy abroad each
year, and, consequently, in sending the latter to
Italy in 1595 with a tutor, and a servant, allowed
him treble that amount, one hundred pounds.
The tutor writes, "I never endured such slavery
in my life to save money"; if Mr. Davison does
not see his way to changing his mind about the
one hundred pounds a year, will he kindly find
another tutor? As to the "frugal travellers"
whose travelling costs them no more than the one
hundred marks a year, he does not wish to deny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>it; in fact, he knows such men; and very sorry he
is for those who have lent them the rest they have
spent.</p>

<p>From all this one may conclude that the equivalent
of four hundred pounds a year was the minimum
for respectable travelling and that the Average
Tourist would certainly need at least half as
much again. But this is assuming that all who were
respectable, or above the need to be so, paid all
their own expenses, which was far from being the
case. There were plenty of rich travellers who
defrayed all charges for a large following. Landgraf
Ludwig <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> of Hessen-Darmstadt<a name="Anchor-118" id="Anchor-118"></a><a href="#Footnote-118" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 118.">[118]</a> even paid
a certain knight to accompany him, six hundred
florins [£600] down and fifty florins a month,
besides expenses and clothes. So when Cardinal
Luigi d'Aragona toured Europe, starting May 9,
1517, and arriving home March 16, 1518, and
spent about fifteen thousand ducats [£35,000]
meantime, in which "eating and drinking were
the least costly items," we may conclude that the
thirty-five persons he took with him, and the forty-five
he brought back, received at least expenses.
Another churchman, Johann Gottfried von Aschhausen,
bishop of Würzburg, left Strassburg in
1612 with a retinue of one hundred and thirty,
twenty-one of whom were young men of high
birth. Before he passed out of Germany this
number was increased by fifty more. He was
away a year in Italy, which cost him thirty-two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>thousand seven hundred and fifty-four scudi
[£40,000].<a name="Anchor-119" id="Anchor-119"></a><a href="#Footnote-119" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 119.">[119]</a></p>

<p>But since he went as the Emperor's ambassador,
this is rather a fresh example of how travelling
was facilitated by embassies. For among the
advantages of various kinds that rendered accompanying
the journeyings of diplomatists the best
means of seeing the world, the economical advantages
were as important as any. It by no means
followed, however, that anything but board and
lodging were provided by him; in the detailed accounts
of Sir G. Chaworth regarding his special
embassy to Brussels is no mention of outlay on
anything but necessaries. On the other hand, we
find another English ambassador giving one hundred
pounds apiece to the gentlemen who were
to accompany him, to provide their outfit.<a name="Anchor-120" id="Anchor-120"></a><a href="#Footnote-120" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 120.">[120]</a> In
any case, this expedient extended only as far as
the ambassador went, a specially important limitation
for Englishmen of Queen Elizabeth's day,
since she had no ambassador at Venice throughout
her reign; and even when James <abbr title="the first">I</abbr> sent one thither
he was, during his first term of office, the only
English ambassador in Italy. Bearing this in
mind, and turning to other methods whereby the
Average Tourist from England might reduce his
expenditure, we come upon what is, perhaps, the
most remarkable fact of the time in regard to the
kind, and the extent, of the usefulness with which
travel was credited, namely, that Queen Elizabeth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>subsidised it. It is obvious from the life-stories
of all those who served her that they were treated
with extreme stinginess and that employment by
the government meant heavy expense instead of
salaries; and yet, as to travel, these are the words
of Bacon, who had excellent means of knowing the
facts: "There was a constant course held, that
by the advice of the secretaries, or some principal
councillor, there was always sent forth into the
parts beyond the seas some young men of whom
good hopes were conceived of their towardliness,
to be trained up and made fit for such public employments
and to learn the languages. This was
at the charge of the Queen, which was not much,
for they travelled but as private gentlemen."<a name="Anchor-121" id="Anchor-121"></a><a href="#Footnote-121" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 121.">[121]</a></p>

<p>Ecclesiastics, it goes almost without saying,
received special terms, mainly in the shape of free
lodging at religious houses, although the opinion of
one abbé ought not to go unrecorded,—"avoid
monasteries," because the charities expected
amounted to more than inn-charges. This certainly
did not apply to Muscovy, where, if a monastery
could be found, it undoubtedly did mean
free board and lodging for the three days, the
usual limit of time, universally, for claimers of
charity. But what with monasteries and special
foundations there must have been far more really
free accommodation than is apparent from tourist-books,
written as the latter almost entirely are by
the class that paid its way. Even apart from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>above there were incidents such as one recorded
in 1650, of eight thousand pilgrims to Rome from
Spain being fed and housed for three days at
Naples at the expense of the Spanish viceroy
there. At Compostella, too, for two reals [7s. 6d.]
could be obtained a parchment document with a
cardinal's seal attached, recommending the bearer
for alms as one who was on his way to other places
of pilgrimage; and in Italy not even that much
was needed, inasmuch as the natives were then so
averse to begging that foreigners who had no such
scruples found little difficulty in traversing it at
next to no cost.</p>

<p>Where a begging-license was necessary, that
could easily be obtained also by being, or pretending
to be, a student. Loyola lived in term-time
at Paris on what he gained by begging at
fairs in Flanders and England during holidays.
Another useful option open to students, of whatever
social position, was the exemption from local
tolls, frequently a privilege belonging to all who
had matriculated at the university of the district;
the graduate of Padua, for instance, was exempt
throughout Venetian territory. It so happened
that one of these tourists<a name="Anchor-122" id="Anchor-122"></a><a href="#Footnote-122" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 122.">[122]</a> was elected rector of
Bologna University during his stay there in 1575,
and that during his term of office some students
were forced to pay taxes. He and the managing
body at once appealed to the Pope, who not
only confirmed, but extended, the immunities.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>In Italy the tolls were so oppressive that the
matriculation fees, twenty lire [£5] at Padua,
twelve at Bologna, were soon made good, even
supposing them to have been paid; at Bologna, at
least, matriculation could be obtained for nothing
by applying in <span xml:lang="la" lang="la">formâ pauperis</span>. The examination
was no bar worth mentioning. In Germany,
moreover, according to Moryson, the tenancy of
a house often carried with it the obligation to
board and lodge a student free. Another traveller
who economised thoroughly was Sastrow, who,
on reaching Rome, took service at the hospital of
Santa Brigitta, cooked, washed-up, made the beds,
and received the equivalent of 2s. 6d. a month,
while Jacques Callot, the artist, when he ran
away from home, took the way to Italy in the
company of those gypsies who appear in those
sketches of his which form one of the most vivid
memorials of the travelling life of the time. Yet
with all these opportunities which presented
themselves to the needy, we are told that Turkey
was the only country of Europe where poverty
was no bar to travel.</p>

<p>Outside Europe fresh estimates have to be
quoted. The fare to Jaffa and back by the pilgrim-galley
varied from fifty to sixty ducats [say
£100]: this included food. Additional expenses
brought the ordinary cost of a visit to Jerusalem
from Venice under these earlier conditions up to
three or four hundred pounds in present-day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>values. This, of course, omits the expenses of
the pilgrim between his home and Venice. The
minimum recorded cost for this period is represented
by the two hundred and twenty crowns
[£350] spent by one Switzer in thirty weeks, and
two hundred and twenty-eight crowns spent by
another, a barber, in eleven months (1583-84),<a name="Anchor-123" id="Anchor-123"></a><a href="#Footnote-123" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 123.">[123]</a>
of which times only about three months, in each
case, was taken up by the voyage from Venice to
Jerusalem and back, the remainder being devoted
to Italy. The pilgrimage may be considered as
accounting for but little more than two hundred
pounds of the expenditure of each. Many went,
moreover, who never possessed this much, since it
was common for one man to go as deputy for several,
who jointly defrayed his expenses; and it was
also a common form of charity for rich pilgrims
to pay for poor ones. Later, in fact, they were
often forced to do so by the Turks when the latter
had reduced to beggary those who had come away
with too little, which led to there arising a custom
among pilgrims of showing each other their
money; if one refused, the others avoided his company
to escape the possibility of being compelled
to pay for him.</p>

<p>With the cessation of the pilgrim-galley the
cost of the pilgrimage doubled itself, what with
the increased length of the journey due to a roundabout
way having to be taken, and, still more, to
its increased duration, owing to the uncertainty;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>especially as every day additional brought its
own additional risks and extortions. Moryson
and his brother spent four hundred and eighty
pounds [nearly, if not quite, £3000].</p>

<p>Certain circumstances raised the cost to him
above the average, and he was away more than a
year and a half, whereas the journey would be
done within the year ordinarily. On the other
hand, as his brother died near Aleppo, the return-journey
represents the expenditure of one man
instead of two. How a thrifty man who was used
to roughing it would be forced to spend the equivalent
of one thousand pounds or more on a journey
that would nowadays cost him about sixty-five
pounds is partly explained by the exactions
of the Turks. When Sandys was at Jerusalem the
monks of S. Salvatore had just been compelled
to pay eight hundred dollars [£900] for an imaginary
offence. When Lithgow arrived late one
night after the gates had been shut, the friars
let down food to him over the wall; the Turks,
being informed of this, insisted they must have
been importing weapons, and inflicted another
fine, one hundred piasters [£125]. It is not surprising,
then, that with expenses like these, and
ordinary expenses to match, the monks expected
sums from the pilgrims that seem at first sight
outrageous. To Lithgow they made a definite
charge of a piaster [£1 10s.] a day for board and
lodging alone; but their general custom was to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>throw themselves on the traveller's generosity
and grumble at the result.</p>

<p>Neither did the Franks suffer from indirect
exactions only. The price for entrance to the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre went on increasing,
from nothing at all in the fourteenth century to
four zecchini [£10] in 1606. Some mention fees
of four times that amount, but this higher sum
included the toll at the city gate, the two being
collected simultaneously and so mistaken for one
charge: the Turks farmed the revenue from the
Holy Sepulchre for eight thousand sultanons [over
£19,000], says Sandys. Extras were almost endless,
yet very few of them left any change out of
a gold coin; the fee for the certificate of visitation,
without which the poorest pilgrim would not think
of departing, was three zecchini [seven guineas],
while the knighthood, nominally thirty zecchini,
does not seem to have been granted for less than
ten. The monastery servants were liable to excommunication
if they accepted a tip, but they gladly
risked damnation for a zecchino, and, indeed, insisted
on doing so.</p>

<p>By spending not more than a week at Jerusalem
and that at a time which may profanely be
termed out of the season, it was possible to see
the sights of the city itself for the equivalent of
£50; at any rate, that happened in 1676;<a name="Anchor-124" id="Anchor-124"></a><a href="#Footnote-124" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 124.">[124]</a>
do as most Franks did, spend Easter there, and
ten days or a fortnight, and accompany the excursions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>cost nearly double that. On the journey,
the tributes may be imagined from the fact that
Sandys thought it worth while to pay four shariffs
[£10] for a passport which saved a few of them;
nothing availed against an Arab chief who sent
to demand seven zecchini [sixteen guineas] a head,
and then came in person to demand five more.
Moreover, besides the special outfit to be bought,
the charges themselves were always reckoned on
the basis that a Frank <em>must</em> have heaps of money;
from Rama to Jerusalem alone, one day's journey,
another seven zecchini had to be paid to the
dragoman, and the same amount coming back.</p>

<p>A considerable saving might be effected by
hiring a Janizary at seven aspers [2s.] a day: his
services more than paid for his keep; and there
were times when even a Frank found himself
living at an easy rate. This happened when he
stayed at a "fondaco," or depôt of Christian
traders, or so it may be inferred from casual remarks
backed up by two definite instances in
years far apart. The German Fürer lived so at
Alexandria and Cairo for the equivalent of five
shillings a day in 1565, and in 1625 two Germans<a name="Anchor-125" id="Anchor-125"></a><a href="#Footnote-125" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 125.">[125]</a>
were received for two months free of all charges
at the Venetian "fondaco" at Cairo.</p>

<p>Far above all economies, however, was the system
known as "putting-out" money—and this
applied to travel inside, as well as outside, Christendom.
The mediæval custom of presenting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>offerings before starting had died out; sixteenth-century
tourists only offered prayers, and, for the
rest, often expected to take up, at their homecoming,
all they had left behind them with additions,
or even multiplication. They deposited,
or "put out," money before their departure on
that condition. The custom is said to have been
developed in the Netherlands<a name="Anchor-126" id="Anchor-126"></a><a href="#Footnote-126" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 126.">[126]</a> during the first
half of the sixteenth century out of a pilgrims'
practice of leaving a will behind them in favour of
a friend on the understanding that the pilgrim
was to receive double the bequest if he came back.
It would seem from what Moryson says that the
custom was barely known in England till the last
decade of the sixteenth century, and then spread
so rapidly that it fell into disrepute, bankrupts
employing it to reinstate themselves, and actors,
then the scum of the populace, to gain notoriety.
He apologises for his brother Henry doing it, who
put out four hundred pounds to be repaid twelve
hundred pounds if he came back from Jerusalem.
If allusions to the practice in contemporary English
literature<a name="Anchor-127" id="Anchor-127"></a><a href="#Footnote-127" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 127.">[127]</a> can be trusted, he drove a bad
bargain; according to them he might have arranged
for his hypothetical profit to be five hundred
instead of three hundred per cent, the latter
rate being granted against journeys to Italy. The
only other instance known of an actual transaction
of this kind was calculated to yield two thousand
per cent [£10 to be repaid £200]; but this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>was against a voyage to Russia, near the middle
of the century, from London, whence only one
ship was known to have sailed thither and returned.</p>

<p>Life insurance in its present form was also
adopted by some persons before starting for abroad;
but public opinion condemned every form of life
insurance equally as immoral, and in the Netherlands,
France, and Genoa it was forbidden by law,
"travel-wagers" being specially mentioned in the
proclamations. The rate, however, is the point
which specially concerns us here, as indicative of
the risks of travel. At the present day, for all the
parts of the world touched upon in this book, the
safest insurance company will not only lay fifty to
one that the traveller <em>will</em> return, in place of the
rate then of three to five to one that he would <em>not</em>,
but will further insure him against accidents at a
lower rate than if he became a London butcher.
The system is of interest, too, as marking the transition
from mediæval to modern methods of insurance;
from "protections" granted by the stronger
to the weaker for a premium which took the form
of personal service, to the capitalist's bond; the
guarantee of redress by force being superseded by
guarantee of reimbursement by a business man,
because the latter had become both more feasible
and more satisfactory.</p>

<p>It is clear, then, that, given the most favourable
circumstances, the traveller might not only make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>his journeys pay their own expenses, but might
clear a handsome profit. Yet how far these circumstances
were made the most of is a question
that has at present to be decided on negative evidence
alone, the verdict on which must be that no
case is made out. In leaving, therefore, the general
estimates for details, both have to be put forward
as net, subject to the mitigations already
referred to.</p>

<p>The fare from Dover to Calais was five shillings
throughout this period. So invariable was this
charge that when a certain boatman was suspected
of being in league with the Roman Catholic
seminarists in France because he conveyed
across some ladies who were religious fugitives, he
was considered not guilty on its being ascertained
that he had charged them one pound each for
the passage.<a name="Anchor-128" id="Anchor-128"></a><a href="#Footnote-128" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 128.">[128]</a> This five-shilling charge did not include
the cost of boarding and landing when that
required, as so often happened, the use of small
boats, or of porters wading out. Between Flushing
and Gravesend 6s. 8d. seems to have been
the fare.<a name="Anchor-129" id="Anchor-129"></a><a href="#Footnote-129" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 129.">[129]</a></p>

<div class="caption">A PASSENGER-BOAT FROM PADUA</div>
</div>

<p>Among the reasons for the preference of travel
by water rather than by land, one was economy.
In the case of tolls, for example, the case has been
exactly reversed. As locks did not exist there were
no river-dues; but of highway-tolls plenty; moreover,
it often cost something to cross a bridge but
never a sou to pass under it. As for ferries, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>ferryman occasionally made the passengers pay
what he pleased by collecting fares in the middle
of the river. Yet another reason which raised the
cost of road-travel as against river-travel lay in
the latter affording far fewer chances to robbers,
which also told on the direct expense by eliminating
payments to escorts.</p>

<p>The contrast, of course, between horse and boat
was much greater than between waggon and boat.
In fact, the choice between the latter pair was
many times a matter of comfort rather than of
cost; the fares for both, in all normal cases but
one where they can be exactly determined, varying
from three farthings to a penny ha'penny a
mile. To compare this with existing railway fares
we may strike an average and say sixpence a mile;
but the charges will be found to approach the minimum
more often on the river than in the waggon.
A typical instance is the five stivers [2s. 6d.] on
the nine-mile canal between Haarlem and Amsterdam,
and the lowest, the exception just spoken
of, is the sixteen soldi [3s. 6d.] for the twenty-four
miles by river and lagoon between Venice
and Padua, recorded by Villamont in 1591, and
by Van Buchell in 1587. One disadvantage common
to both cart and boat must not be forgotten—that,
to profit by this relative cheapness, the
traveller had to form one of a party; if no party
was ready he had to wait till one collected. Sir
Henry Wotton, to take one example out of many,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>once wanted to go by waggon from Brunswick to
Frankfort, about one hundred and fifty miles;
had he started on the spot he would have started
alone and paid at the rate of 4s. 6d. a mile of our
money. He waited a week before two disreputable
specimens turned up to share the expense.</p>

<p>This freedom to choose one's company was a
decided advantage for the traveller who rode, considering
that murdering was far less exclusively a
lower-class habit than it has since become. But
he had to pay dearly for the increased respectability
and pace. Horse-hire varied from a penny
ha'penny to fivepence a mile, the maximum charge
representing the cost of post-horses in France in
the seventeenth century, the minimum the charge
in Italy for a horse that was waiting for a return
fare, an opportunity that might frequently be met
with. The average was far nearer the maximum
than the minimum rate, since it was often a case
of post-horse or no horse, and post rates did not
sink so very far below the French standard. According
to Moryson, the English charged two
shillings a day in London, one shilling a day in
the provinces, for other than post-horses, but he
was a native and the charges to foreigners probably
exceeded the charges to natives throughout
Europe in a greater degree then than now; an
Englishman on the way from Calais to Paris
complains that he had to pay £2 15s. where a
Frenchman paid but three pistoles at sixteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>shillings and eightpence each;<a name="Anchor-130" id="Anchor-130"></a><a href="#Footnote-130" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 130.">[130]</a> and that is not
an isolated grievance. In fact, as a comment on
Moryson's remark about England, when Lionello,
a secretary of the Venetian ambassador, went post
to Edinburgh and back in June, 1617, besides paying
threepence a mile for each horse, he includes in
his accounts as usual tips fourpence to the woman
and sixpence to the horse-boy, at each stage.<a name="Anchor-131" id="Anchor-131"></a><a href="#Footnote-131" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 131.">[131]</a> In
Italy, where several foreigners found the cost of
riding less than the average, Villamont reckons
that an écu [two guineas] a day per horse covered
all horse-charges, while in passing from Germany
to Italy the best plan was to buy a horse in Germany,
where three pounds would be a fair price,
and sell it in Italy, which could be done at double
that price.</p>

<p>Travellers' evidence, however, as to horse-charges
is less plentiful than might be expected,
owing to what may be called the 'vetturino' system.
The term 'vetturino' came to be applied,
even outside Italy, to the horse-owner or carrier
who contracted for the whole cost of a journey,
food, lodging, transport, tolls. Their reputation
is best illustrated by the tale of an abbé at Loreto
about this time, who, in confessing, included
among his transgressions a beating inflicted on a
'vetturino.' "Go on," said the confessor, "that
doesn't count; they're the worst scoundrels in
the world." Nevertheless, the method spread all
over Europe during this period with striking rapidity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>though far more readily on the road than on
the water. The advantages to the stranger were
recognised at once, the saving of the trouble and
the expense which accompanied repeated bargaining
in a state of ignorance as to where and how to
do it, what inns to go to, what extras to put up
with, what the legal dues really were, etc. However
dishonest the 'vetturino' might prove, his
victim probably paid no more to him in unintentional
commission than his accomplices would have
extorted on their own account otherwise. For the
Lyons-Turin journey, at least, there soon came
into use a regular formula for a written contract, a
formula which has been preserved.<a name="Anchor-132" id="Anchor-132"></a><a href="#Footnote-132" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 132.">[132]</a> The system
has its value for us, too, in enabling us to compare
prices. While there are multitudes of figures
apparently available for the purpose of reckoning
cost, a large majority turn out to be, to use one
of their own phrases, no more use than a wooden
poker, the writer omitting one or more of the necessary
data. If, for instance, he mentions the hire
of four horses, it leaves us in the dark in reckoning
personal expenses, inasmuch as four horses may
equally well imply two, or three, or four persons.
So likewise, to complete an account of a waggon-fare,
it needs to be stated whether or no it was
what the Germans called "<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">maul frei</span>," that is,
whether the coachman paid for his own food or
not. Or again, riding was so much the rule that
the charge which the wayfarer gives for bed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>breakfast often includes, probably more often
than not, the "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">stabulum et pabulum</span>" for his
horse; it is only on the rare occasions when specific
statement is made, or when a pedestrian gives
prices, that there is any certainty about it. Now
the vetturino's charge does away with all this uncertainty.
Also as to whether a guide accompanied
the party or not—another necessary which cost
money; especially a satisfactory one, obtainable
only, writes Sir Philip Sidney, "by much expense
or much humbleness."</p>

<p>Here again the traveller by waggon went more
cheaply than the horseman. What with the absence
of sign-posts, the scarcity of persons to ask,
the frequent indistinguishableness of the road
from its margin and its surroundings, a stranger
was practically forced to be guided. In 1648 this
brought the cost of a journey from London to
Dover to £1 15s. 10d.<a name="Anchor-133" id="Anchor-133"></a><a href="#Footnote-133" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 133.">[133]</a> [say, £8]. In a town this
applied to every one who had no friends there.
Every single feature on which one depends nowadays
was absent, or, if present, present only in
embryo,—visible street-names, printed suggestions
other than historical, detailed plans, the
wide, straight streets which allow the mystified
to discover his whereabouts without climbing a
church-tower. In short, what was worth seeing
was mostly heard of only by word of mouth, and to
find it one needed to be led there. Expenditure
on guides reached its highest point when the Alps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>were snowbound; after a heavy fall he who wished
to pass must wait till others had made fresh tracks
or pay anything up to fifty crowns [£75] to have
it done for him.</p>

<p>To pass Mont Cenis cost in the ordinary way
the equivalent of about £4 10s.; that is, about half
what the 'vetturino' would want to take each
one of several from Lyons to Turin—six crowns,
which latter sum is about ten times as much as
the second-class fare to-day. But then the journey
takes twelve hours now and took seven days then,
with food all the while at travellers' prices.</p>

<p>The length of journeys stands out as the chief
factor in the comparative costliness. Take a typical
case, that of the five middle-class men<a name="Anchor-134" id="Anchor-134"></a><a href="#Footnote-134" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 134.">[134]</a> who
left Venice on February 20, 1655, who wasted no
time on the way, reached England on March 29,
and spent one hundred and twenty-five pounds.
Reckoning this as equalling £625, this works out
as the equivalent of £125 each for thirty-seven
days, or £3 7s. 7d. a day. If a man left Venice now
on February 20, he might break the journey at
Bâle, to do things comfortably, and arrive in London
at 5.38 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. M.</span> on February 22. Second-class
fare would be £5 10s. 7d.; add £2 for meals and
incidentals, £7 10s. 7d. in all, an average of £3 3s.
a day. The other thirty-four and a half days of the
thirty-seven his food would be paid for at home
rates, say 2s. 6d. a day, £4 6s. 3d., which, added
to the £7 10s. 7d., gives £11 16s. 10d. Now the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>daily average of about 7s. higher in the cost of
travel apart from food, as above represented,—mainly
accounted for by the relative cost of horses
and guides as against railway fares,—only comes
to £13 in thirty-seven days. On this basis the
journey from Venice to London two hundred and
fifty years ago cost between nine and ten times
as much as it would to-day, solely on account of
the difference in speed. That the expenditure of
these five middle-class men was very reasonable
is easily verifiable, as, for example, by the accounts
of Muscorno,<a name="Anchor-135" id="Anchor-135"></a><a href="#Footnote-135" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 135.">[135]</a> another Venetian secretary, whose
bill for coming to England, for himself and a
servant, comes to three hundred and two ducats
[£385]. If there was one place where travelling
ought to have worked out relatively cheaply, it
was Muscovy, seeing that on the sledges a peasant
would take a passenger fifty leagues for three or
four crowns; but it does not seem to have lowered
the expenses of one Dr. Willes, whose overland
journey thither in 1600 cost eighty pounds, including
payments to guides. His own share may
be reckoned as equivalent to two hundred and
forty pounds as compared with the fifteen pounds
the same route would cost to-day.</p>

<p>Luggage would frequently entail the same fare
as the owner, since an extra horse would be needed
to carry a box. Leather trunks were to be purchased
which might be carried in front of the rider,
but these did not protect the contents against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>rain. As to what carriers took as free luggage and
what as "excess," there is no evidence but that of
one Englishman<a name="Anchor-136" id="Anchor-136"></a><a href="#Footnote-136" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 136.">[136]</a> who found he was entitled to five
pounds free on the Calais-Paris road and paid ten
shillings surcharge on the rest without comment.
Any advice the experienced have to offer as regards
reduction of luggage for economy is in view
far less of carriage than of customs-duties. In
Italy the exactions were severest; almost every
day's journey would take one over some boundary
and at every bridge there were two or three quattrini
[twopence] to pay; at every gate six or eight
soldi [one shilling], besides baggage dues. Any
article carried through Italy would cost its price
over again in dues; a sword, for instance, you had
to give up at the gate, pay a man to carry it to
the inn, where the host took care of it till your
departure, when you had to pay again for its carriage
to the gate. The Papal states had the lowest
scale of charges, yet on crossing their boundary,
there was a giulio [3s. 6d.] to pay for the smallest
hand-bag; and at Florence even your corpse
would be taxed a crown [£1 10s.] if it went in or
out of the city for burial. In Germany, where the
burden was lighter, Sir Thomas Hoby, coming down
the Rhine in 1555, paid toll at twenty-one custom-houses
between Mainz and Herzogensbosch to
fourteen authorities. As a rule, too, the taxes were
farmed, which increased the tourists' sufferings
from them, inasmuch as they were exacted with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>greater rigour and it was the harder to get redress
in cases of extortion, especially when, as in Poland
and Spain, the 'farmers' were Jews or of Jewish
blood. Bribery, however, was often practicable,
and where practicable, economical; one of the best
guides to Spain repeats concerning every custom-house
that the traveller should say he has nothing
to declare and tip the officials only if they take his
word, that is, if they do not do their duty. It is
true there were passes to be obtained from a central
authority, overriding the right of search, such
as the imperial pass in Germany, and the indefinite
rights of ambassadors, but how far these were
respected seems to have been mainly a matter of
bluff. Navagero, in Spain early in the sixteenth
century, ambassador though he was, had to pay
duties even on the rings on his fingers.</p>

<p>Passports, for one purpose or another, may be
said to have been as much the rule then as they
have since become the exception; an Englishman
must pay five shillings for leave to travel and another
five shillings if he wished to take his horse
with him. A Frenchman at Milan speaks of getting
a passport, stating his destination and the
colour of his hair; and so on. But few mention
such expenses being entailed as does one Italian,<a name="Anchor-137" id="Anchor-137"></a><a href="#Footnote-137" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 137.">[137]</a>
leaving Dover in 1606. Apparently he had to pay
for separate passports for each of his suite as well
as himself, as these cost forty reals. The "real of
eight" was nearly equal to five shillings English.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>The captain of the vessel demanded copies which
"cost very dear" and the harbour-keeper, furthermore,
who had exacted two giuli [six shillings],
(each person?) on arrival, required double at departure.</p>

<p>Guide-books seem to have been from two to four
times the price of Baedekers, a minor item, but
considerable, like food and lodging. It may seem,
at first sight, as if food and lodging were far from
minor items, and that truly, of course, if only the
total expenditure is considered. But in considering,
as is being done here, relative cost only, that
is, the cost of travel in so far as it has altered
since three centuries ago, it has to be borne in
mind that the average cost of food and shelter
never alters; it is only standards of living that
alter. If any one took the average price of meals,
say, in Europe then and average prices now, and
showed a difference of net cost between them, his
calculations must either be based on misleading
information, or else would prove that the figure
he was multiplying with to equate values was a
wrong one. This, of course, refers to necessaries;
luxuries must be ruled out for two reasons: first,
all attempts to fix a standard or strike an average
breaks down for lack of a basis; second, they do
not test what any one is called upon to spend but
only how much he can spend if he is fool enough
to try. Thus, for example, when Montaigne tells
us that the charges at the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Vaso d'Oro</span>" at Rome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>would be about twenty crowns [£35] a month, we
may conclude that if we ascertain what the average
charges would be for the same accommodation
at a first-rate hotel to-day, it is a more reasonable
plan to take the difference as the difference between
their money-values and ours than to accept
a surplus in either, according to the usually accepted
multiplying figure, as defining an increase
or decrease in hotel charges.</p>

<p>Yet for all this, something remains to be said.
A modern tourist often finds himself in the position
of drawing his income from a locality where
money is cheaper or dearer than in the districts
where he is making his payments. Now, three
hundred years ago, he would have met with these
fluctuations more frequently and more suddenly
than would be the case to-day; and when met
with, they would often have been more violent.
In so far as this was the case, so far is the relative
cost affected. The causes of these fluctuations
may be divided into (1) local custom, (2)
insufficient linking-up of supply and demand.
Hungary may be taken as an example of the latter,
Germany of the former, cause; Poland and
Spain of districts where social and economic forces
jib at separate classification. In Hungary and the
districts southeast of it the most seasoned traveller
never failed to be astonished at the ideal
natural conditions; "wheat," as Sir Thomas
Browne's son said of Transylvania in particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>a little later, "had no value in relation to the
subsistence of a human being." There was no
outlet for its products; the continual state of war
kept commerce paralysed; Vienna had little need
of it, Constantinople none at all; what the fertility
of the soil produced so abundantly was thus
available for local consumption only. Especially
was this the case with products that needed no human
tending; the man who ate a whole penn'orth
of fish risked bursting. In Germany prices ruled
low, yet so excessive was the drunkenness, and so
general, that it was a moral impossibility to live
cheaply without cutting one's self off from human
society. Supper over, for instance, the "<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">schlafftrinke</span>"
was set on the table, and whoever
touched a drop of it had, by custom, to pay an
even share with those who drank till morning.</p>

<p>The Spanish diet, which was such a trial to the
inside if the stranger did conform to it, was equally
a trial to his pocket if he did not. One tried both
ways on one day in 1670.<a name="Anchor-138" id="Anchor-138"></a><a href="#Footnote-138" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 138.">[138]</a> At noon he shared the
landlord's dinner, paying a real [2s. 6d.] for vegetables,
dried fish, fruit; but when in the evening he
was one of six who dined on four fowls and neck of
mutton, his bill came to the equivalent of £1 5s.
not including wine. Poland, on the contrary, being
the granary of Europe and exporting much
else besides grain, rich in serf labour, and with its
retail trade in the hands of denationalised aliens
who were well under control, could afford to import
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>plenty of luxuries and enjoyed abundance of
necessaries: a goose or a pig for the equivalent of
1s. 6d., a loin of mutton for 1s.—such were prices
in Poland.</p>

<p>A good test of relative cheapness is the value of
the coin most generally useful; in Poland these
were the brass 'banns,' worth about a penny farthing
in to-day's values. Of Italy a similar statement
may be made; of England just the contrary.
And this presence, or absence, of plenty of small
coins affects the tourist in two ways; partly in relation
to his food, because the more common small
change is, the more commonly customary is it to
sell food in quantities suited to a single meal for
one; secondly, the smaller the change, the smaller
the tips. Before leaving the subject of food, an
example may be quoted of the violence of the
fluctuations in prices at that date when the means
of carriage and of making wants known in time
were so crude. Sir Henry Wotton writes, of his
own knowledge, that the price of victuals at Venice
was three times as high in 1608 as it had been
in 1604.</p>

<p>Lastly, as regards necessary expenditure, what
did their money itself cost them?</p>

<p>To begin with, the far greater length of time
usually necessary then to prove identity, or to
confirm references, must not be lost sight of, seeing
how much it added to the seriousness of the
hope deferred that maketh the pocket empty.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>
<p>Next, to deal with the ways of remedying this—there
were three ways, (1) Carrying cash; (2)
depositing money with a merchant, or a friend,
who either remits coins or advises an amount;
(3) letters of credit.</p>

<p>Carrying cash meant carrying coins. At any
rate, not one of these travellers mentions using
the bank-notes of the day, the 'segni reppresentativi'
just introduced by the Italian bankers,
nor even the ancient semi-currency of jewels, unless
one includes Henri <abbr title="the third">III</abbr>, who, when escaping
from the throne of Poland to that of France, carried
off three hundred thousand crowns' worth.
Carrying coins for future use meant, in the ordinary
way, sewing them up in one's clothes. The
favourite place was inside a waistband of the
breeches, a double one designed for that purpose,
made of leather or canvas, forming a series of
little pockets, all closed by pulling one string. It
was so that Lithgow was carrying one hundred
and thirty-seven double pieces of gold [probably
double pistoles, equal to £500], when he and the
gold were seized by the Inquisition at Malaga.
Next to the waistband, under the arm-pits was
the most usual spot; but it is given as advisable to
use one's shabbiest garments in any case for this
purpose, as the least likely to be searched thoroughly
by robbers. In Muscovy the boots were
more often used than other articles. A small
reserve might be wrapped round with mending-material,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>with needles sticking into it to add to
the innocence of its appearance; or it might be
hidden at the bottom of a pot of ointment. By
this latter means Moryson saved himself from
utter destitution when robbed, having chosen
ointment which smelt, apparently, like the Muscovite's
fish. Equally ingenious and successful
was another who smuggled all his money past
the Mohammedan customs by hiding it in pork.
Mohammedans themselves used their turbans.</p>

<p class="center">RABELAIS RECEIVES SOME MONEY</p></div>
</div>

<p>The advantages of carrying money in this way—that
of having it at hand for certain—was
outweighed by the chances of robbery or confiscation;
the latter by reason of there being legal
limits to the amounts that might be taken away
from countries and towns. Lyons was the most
liberal, allowing sometimes eighty, sometimes one
hundred "crowns of the sun" [£144 to £180].
Turin allowed fifty silver crowns [£75], Naples
twenty-five; Rome, according to an edict in 1592,
no more than five gold crowns [£8]. The rule in
Spain was that no gold was to leave the country,
and Spanish towns often enforced this against
each other; from Murcia in 1617 no more than
ten "reals of eight" [£11 5s.] might be taken
free, but gold was not confiscated, duty being
levied instead.</p>

<p>As for England, Hentzner found the limit of
£10 in 1599, as did Gölnitz in some year soon
after 1618, although Moryson, writing between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>these dates, gives £20. Still earlier, the Frenchman
Perlin, who was here at the beginning of
Queen Mary's reign, says that a pedestrian may
take no more than ten crowns [£27], a horseman
twenty, out of the realm; adding, however, that
a man may convert the rest of his cash into goods
and so, by realising these goods later, prevent confiscation;
and also, that by accompanying an ambassador
one is exempt from search. When it is
remembered, further, that Francis Davison got
inserted in his license to travel a clause enabling
him to carry fifty pounds across with him (for three
persons), that there were trustworthy merchants
who would authorise correspondents abroad to pay
the traveller whatever the latter might have deposited
with them, and that these customs concerning
the export of gold and silver were in use
throughout Europe, it will be seen that if a traveller
suffered loss by confiscation, he deserved his
losses.</p>

<p>By far the greater number had their money
advised at a cost of five to fifteen per cent, usually
ten per cent, as against the three-quarters per
cent which would probably represent a maximum
of loss by exchange to-day to tourists. An unknown
quantity lay in the differences of values,
which might yield a profit, or might involve heavy
loss. Bimetallism prevailed all over Europe, and
the values of gold and silver both relative to each
other and positive, fluctuated far more violently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>than is the case to-day. When Cavendish returned
to England after his first circumnavigation of the
world, the plunder depreciated gold in London
by one twelfth; in 1603 the exchange from Venice
to London was twenty-eight per cent in favour
of Venice; in 1606 it was six per cent higher London
to Venice than Venice to London.</p>

<p>But with all its disadvantages, remitting by
advice was the most generally satisfactory and
used method. The tenour of an average bill, however,
has changed somewhat, "at sight" being the
only one of the variable terms equally customary
both then and now. Bills not drawn "at sight"
were drawn at "usance," "half usance," or "double
usance"; "usance" signifying a month as a
rule. Exceptions were, of course, for longer distances,
such as London and Venice, when "usance"
meant three months; and how completely
"usance" is a term of the past is shown by the
fact that the periods implied by "usance," in the
rare cases in which it is still found in use, have
not altered since the sixteenth century, in spite
of the advance in the quickness of communications.
"Thirds of exchange," now nearly as extinct
as "usances," were then kept in regular use
by the uncertainty of the posts; and in view of
the difficulties in the way of identification and
the advantage that money-changers were likely
to take of them, advices often contained a description
of the payee.<a name="Anchor-139" id="Anchor-139"></a><a href="#Footnote-139" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 139.">[139]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>
<p>Method No. 3, letters of credit, was a more
expensive one than remittance by advice, but for
places for which no "usance" was established,
was obligatory; under favourable circumstances
it might cost no more than ten per cent. There is
evidence enough to justify conjecture that the
English government allowed their credit to be
used sometimes for the convenience of tourists in
order to facilitate a watch being kept on their
movements.<a name="Anchor-140" id="Anchor-140"></a><a href="#Footnote-140" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 140.">[140]</a></p>

<p>Barter also ought not to be wholly left out of
sight. In Norway dried fish was more serviceable
than coin, as was tobacco among Turks, the only
people prompt to copy the English in the use of
it for pleasure; but by the middle of the seventeenth
century the same might be said of Western
Russia. And there is the case of one Thomas
Douglas in 1600 who could not make arrangements
for four hundred crowns to be advised for
him at Algiers, applying to the English government
for leave to take with him duty-free the broadcloth
he had bought with the money and meant
to realise there, to discharge the ransom which the
money represented.<a name="Anchor-141" id="Anchor-141"></a><a href="#Footnote-141" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 141.">[141]</a></p>

<p>Supposing, however, that all these means
failed? The tourist became a beggar till he found
friends. He might try, of course, to raise a loan,
but only on terms which would possibly induce
him to prefer beggary. The "German Ulysses,"
Karl Nützel of Nuremberg, was robbed at Alexandria
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>of his capital; at Cairo he persuaded a
ship's captain to lend him four hundred ducats,
undertaking to pay him six hundred at Constantinople.
They arrived thither in two months; the
interest was therefore at the rate of three hundred
per cent.<a name="Anchor-142" id="Anchor-142"></a><a href="#Footnote-142" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 142.">[142]</a> Sir Henry Wotton, when an
ambassador, paid twenty per cent for a loan at
Venice.</p>


<p class="mt2">In considering loans we have passed away from
necessities into the second half of the subject
of cost,—its reasonable possibilities. These consist
of the risks and difficulties to which the traveller
was liable, nowhere summarised so well as
in the English Litany, which was written at this
period:—</p>

<p>"From lightning and tempest; from plague,
pestilence and famine; from battle and murder;
and from sudden death,</p>

<p>"Good Lord, deliver us."</p>

<p>Of the eight risks here mentioned, to most of
which an Englishman at least was more liable
abroad than at home, all but two have been
minimised since. And if we note how in all other
clauses of the Litany, only those troubles or
desires which have affinity with each other are
grouped together, it becomes significant in what
company travellers are prayed for;—</p>

<p>"That it may please thee to preserve all that
travel by land or water, all women labouring of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>child, all sick persons, and young children; and to
shew thy pity upon all prisoners and captives.</p>

<p>We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord."</p>

<p>To take the risk of violence first, and, among
the forms of violence, war, it has to be remembered
that the United Provinces was the only State
whose soldiers were paid punctually. An effect
of this laxness may be traced in the experience
of a tourist in Picardy when the latter had been
reduced to such a state of destitution by war
that the commandants could not wring anything
further out of the inhabitants and therefore
forced contributions from travellers who passed
through. In 1594 Moryson wished to remit from
Venice to Paris, but no one had any correspondence
farther than Geneva on account of the civil
wars, in spite of these being nominally at an end.
And they assured him it was twenty to one he
would be robbed by the disbanded soldiers (which
came true), and, if robbed, would be killed, because
if they took him for an enemy they would
think him well killed; if a friend, they would kill
him to avoid making restitution; and the marshals
were so strictly looked after that they would
kill anyone who seemed likely to make complaints.
The effect on prices receives illustration by comparing
Andrew Boorde's experience of Aquitaine
after a long period of peace and prosperity,—that
one pennyworth [say 10d.] of bread will feed
a man a week, and they sell nine cakes a penny,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>each cake being enough to last a man a day, "except
he be a ravener,"—with a letter from a Venetian
gentleman,<a name="Anchor-143" id="Anchor-143"></a><a href="#Footnote-143" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 143.">[143]</a> fifty-four years later, by which
time civil war had become chronic. He writes
from England, where he found that a good meal
could be had for ten soldi [2s. 6d.], comparing this
with France, which he had just traversed, where
the same could not be bought for less than sixty
soldi, or even a whole gold crown [£1 13s.]. As
to Germany, in 1623, only five years after the
Thirty Years' War broke out, Wotton writes that
prices have risen enormously, "insomuch as I am
almost quite out of hope to find Conscience any
more, since there is none among the very hills and
deserts, whither I thought she had fled."</p>

<div class="caption">LITHGOW IN TROUBLE</div>
</div>

<p>The effect on communications goes without
saying. Even worse than that was the danger
from those whom the horrible cruelty of sixteenth-century
warfare drove half-mad with grief and
loss, who shook off civilisation and robbed and
murdered recklessly. According to Aubigné, who
witnessed the horrors which he dwells on at length
in his "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Les Tragiques</span>," war demoralised even the
dogs in a way that endangered every passer-by.
Speaking of those around Moncontour, where was

<p>But it may be objected that the evidence of a
sectarian historian is not admissible on any question
of fact. Take, then, what a sober correspondent
writes from the scene of the Thirty Years'
War in 1639, not of dogs, but of men: "It is an
ordinary thing in Brandenburg country to eat
man's flesh,"<a name="Anchor-144" id="Anchor-144"></a><a href="#Footnote-144" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 144.">[144]</a> and he goes on to tell how a judge
has just met his death that way.</p>

<p>Again, De Thou, approaching Mérindol, finds
not a soul to be seen; all had retired to caves at
the sight of armed men. Elsewhere he saw all the
peasants at work armed, and of one town nothing
remained intact but a fountain and one street;
the work of a commander, in the king's name, for
the gratification of his private revenge. The state
produced is well described by Sir Thomas Overbury
in 1609 as one in which there was "no man
but had an enemy within three miles, and so the
country became frontier all over." What "frontier"
meant is well defined by an Italian of this
time as country to which a few could do no harm
and in which many could not live. The prosperity
of the Empire while this was the state of
France has been already outlined; what it became,
as a result of the civil war, while France was
becoming the best organised and most civilised
country in Europe, may be guessed from Reresby's
description of the district which in 1600 had
been the most comfortable in Christendom, that
between Augsburg and Frankfurt; villages and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>towns uninhabited, much ground untilled, no
meat to be had, no sheets, sometimes no beds; for
drink, milk and water, little wine and that sour
and very dear; people so boorish as to resemble
beasts. Significant, too, is it that while Sir Philip
Sidney, defining the qualities of the dominions
of Europe for his brother, writes, "Germany doth
excel in good laws and well administering of
justice," and while all subsequent travellers for
forty years confirm this, a German, Zeiler, compiled
his guide to Spain shortly before the date
when the correspondent just quoted wrote his
letter, and in this guide, in maintaining the claims
of Spain on the attention of the student, puts
among the characteristics in which Spain excels
the rest of Europe, the inflexibility of justice
there.</p>

<p>Yet civil war was less detrimental to touring
than international war, inasmuch as no nation
was barred the country for the time being. Besides,
fewer mercenaries were employed. Now,
however bad the native soldier may have been—and
how bad that was may be judged from
Shakespeare's picture of him in "Henry <abbr title="the fifth">V</abbr>"
(Act <span class="smcap lowercase"><abbr title="3">III</abbr></span>, <abbr title="scene">sc.</abbr> 2),—mercenaries were far worse,
seeing that they behaved in the country they
were defending as the others did only in that
which they attacked. Sastrow followed in the
wake of the mercenaries whom Charles <abbr title="the fifth">V</abbr> imported;
wherever they had passed the way was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>strewn with corpses. In one house he found the
body of a man who had been suspended by the
genitals, a usual custom, while they tortured him
to make him reveal his valuables, and released by
a sword-stroke, not on the cord he hung by, but
"flush with the abdomen." From Bamberg they
carried off four hundred women as far as Nuremberg,
while Hungarians cut off the feet and hands
of children and stuck them in their hats instead
of feathers. And it is perhaps worth while quoting
the effect on Sastrow himself. On his horse
being stolen, he "chose the best nag at hand";
and finding a gentleman's house temporarily
abandoned, he and his companions stole wholesale,
not only to satisfy present wants, but also in
order to realise money later.</p>

<p>The effect of all this so far as it concerned tourists
may be exemplified by the state of the highroad
between Danzig and Hamburg, along which,
in 1600, the only corpses in evidence were those
of criminals. By 1652, in one day's journey, a
traveller<a name="Anchor-145" id="Anchor-145"></a><a href="#Footnote-145" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 145.">[145]</a> could count thirty-four piles of faggots,
each pile marking the spot where a wayfarer had
been murdered. Each passer-by was expected to
add a faggot. Another result was that soldiers
continued to exercise during peace the habits
they had contracted in war. When Lady Fanshawe
passed through Abbeville in 1659, the
governor warned her against local robbers, advising
an escort of garrison soldiers at a pistole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>[£3, 6s. 8d.] each. She engaged ten, and met a
band of fifty 'robbers.' The ten parleyed with
the fifty, and the fifty retired; they, too, were
soldiers of the garrison.</p>

<p>Between the soldier and the robber, in fact, the
difference was merely that of official, and unofficial,
employment. It was in the latter capacity, of
course, that they oftenest had dealings with the
tourist; or were supposed to do so. One cannot help
being struck by the idea that these travellers were
far more frightened than hurt, so far as robbery
was concerned. A lady, for instance, between Turin
and Genoa, saw the road stained with blood where
wayfarers had lately been robbed and murdered,
yet passed in safety.<a name="Anchor-146" id="Anchor-146"></a><a href="#Footnote-146" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 146.">[146]</a> One traveller, it is true,
was stopped four times between <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Malo and
Havre, but more normal experiences were those
of Moryson, who suffered so but once in more
than four years' travel, and of Hentzner, who encountered
robbers once in three years and then
escaped. He had warning and hired an escort; but
it has to be noted that this escort, for one day,
cost more than fifty crowns [£90]. Very similar
was the experience of the Venetian ambassador
Lippomano on his way to Paris in 1577.<a name="Anchor-147" id="Anchor-147"></a><a href="#Footnote-147" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 147.">[147]</a> A
rumour got about that he was conveying a loan
of eight hundred thousand francs to the French
government, and a Venetian ambassador was
easy to get information about because of the red
trappings of his mules. He was warned, and so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>were the towns on the route; with the result that
his own company were refused admission on
suspicion that they were the highwaymen in disguise;
and watched, as they passed, by garrisons
on the walls. For six days they marched in continual
fear; swords drawn, arquebus-matches
lighted. Once they thought the "volori" really
were upon them, but out of the cloud of dust
galloped nothing but the escort from Troyes to
relieve the escort from Bar-sur-Seine. And in
the end they were fleeced by none but the escorts
themselves.</p>

<p>These escorts were part of the life of the time;
important towns kept them as a matter of course,
in default of a system of country-police such as
existed in Spain, the "Santa Hermandad," who
first suppressed the thieves and then took over,
and extended, their business. In France, however,
towards the end of this period, the highways began
to be patrolled regularly by police, in couples,
none but whom might carry firearms. Yet this
arrangement was in force when of the travellers
who followed just behind Evelyn on the Paris-Orleans
road, four were killed. And within a few
years of this some one tells us how he heard cries
issuing from the inside of a dead horse, cut open
by robbers in order to give themselves more time
to escape by fastening their victim inside it, a dirty
trick, literally, for he was pulled out in as untidy a
state as it was possible for a stark-naked man to be.</p>

<p>To meet, when alone, with two ruffians, to pretend,
being on foot and decidedly shabby, to be
a beggar; and to pass them thus, not only without
loss, but with 1s. 2d. towards his next meal—such
was the experience of one Englishman
abroad. But what could he have done had the
beasts been four-legged ones? Here was another
risk to run; and, perhaps, to pay for. There were
plenty to meet. It is not surprising to read of
them breaking into stables and ransacking cemeteries
in Muscovy, where, by the way, protection
against them was supposed to be secured
by the noise of a big stick dragging at the back
of the sledge by a rope; but things were little
better near Paris. Readers of Rabelais may recollect
a second narrow escape that befell the six pilgrims
whom Gargantua ate in a salad in consequence
of their hiding among the lettuces to avoid
being eaten by him as meat. After their miraculous
escape out of his mouth, they barely saved
themselves from falling into a snare for wolves. It
was no exaggeration to write so about Touraine;
in the winter of 1653 a pack entered Blois and
ate a child. And just before Evelyn visited Fontainebleau,
"a lynx or ounce" had killed some
one passing thither by the highroad from Paris.
The country between Geneva and Lyons, again,
writes one who passed through it, was "mainly
inhabited by wolves and bears."</p>

</div>

<p>But we have not finished with people. Slavery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>had to be reckoned with, and therefore ransoms.
More than one refers to the "malcontents" of
the Low Countries, unpaid Spanish garrison-soldiers
who wandered about on the look-out for
Englishmen in particular, and esteeming a younger
brother's ransom at twenty thousand crowns of
the sun [£35,000], says Wotton. But the risk of
capture, in the ordinary way, was confined to Mohammedan
territory and the neighbouring seashores,
with Algiers as headquarters. Many men
who were slaves there at this period have left record
of their adventures; of whom Gramaye is perhaps
the best to quote from, inasmuch as no one
was a more acute, thorough, and trustworthy observer.
He lived at Algiers in 1619, one of twenty
thousand Christian slaves. According to the statistics
he gives of the previous twelve years, two
hundred and fifty-one ships had brought in twelve
thousand, two hundred and forty prisoners, of
whom eight hundred and fifty-seven Germans had
apostatised, three hundred English, one hundred
and thirty-eight from Hamburg, "Danes and
Easterlings" one hundred and sixty; Poles, Hungarians,
and Muscovites two hundred and fifty,
Low Countrymen one hundred and thirty; besides
French and others. Fewest renegades came
from Spain and Italy, because in those two countries
alone were permanent systematic collectors
of money for ransoms; the two orders of the Trinity
and of Our Lady of Pity paid out sixty-three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>thousand ducats [over £70,000], in this way yearly,
a drain of gold which does not seem to have been
taken into account by economists, although not
counteracted, but on the contrary increased, by
trade transactions with Mohammedan centres like
Constantinople and Aleppo, and added to by all
the privately paid ransoms. Sir Anthony Sherley
ransomed two Portuguese gentlemen for ten thousand
pounds, who had been enslaved sixteen years,
and for one of whom three ransoms had been sent,
each of which had been captured by pirates. The
statement already made about all forms of life insurance
being censured as gambling must be modified
in connection with slavery, for both the law
and public opinion approved of a man paying premiums
to assure a ransom being paid, and that
promptly, in the event of his capture; and the system
seems to have been in frequent use,<a name="Anchor-148" id="Anchor-148"></a><a href="#Footnote-148" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 148.">[148]</a> although
it must be admitted that not one of these travellers
seems so much as aware of its existence.</p>

<p>The expenses of protection against pirates may
be imagined from the estimate for the outfit of the
galley intended to carry the Provençal deputation
to Constantinople in 1585, referred to earlier.
The galley-slaves numbered two hundred; the
deputation fifty. Sixty soldiers were to be taken
for defence, whose wages for the eight months
were to be nineteen hundred and twenty crowns
of the sun; in addition to which was their keep,
nine thousand and forty crowns, and arms and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>gunpowder, five hundred crowns, the total equalling
about twenty-seven thousand pounds of our
money.</p>

<p>Of Turkey Sir Henry Blount says that in assuring
himself against loss of liberty lay "the most expense
and trouble of my voyage." And Blount's
opinion is the better worth having, seeing that
he would have been the last to fail in the exercise
of courtesy and tact, the absence of which is the
commonest cause of martyrdom. Several times
he had to use his knife to avoid being pushed into
a house, and hardly a day passed without his Janizary
being offered a price for him. His defences
against it in general were to cultivate or buy
friends and to make a practice of pretending he
had no friends and little money, and that all that
remained to him was wagered against his return,
because enslavement would be more in hope of
ransom than service.</p>

<p>The enslavement of the Jerusalem pilgrim
seems to have been comparatively rare before the
end of the sixteenth century; yet two of the most
striking narratives belong to the year 1565. The
first adventure, however, happened during an
excursion to Jordan without escort, a risk that
none dreamt of running later. A German, named
Fürer, set out in February, with a friend, a eunuch-interpreter,
and a monk-guide. Sitting down to
a meal on the way back, four Arabs appeared,
whom they treated as guests; yet, the meal over,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>the Arabs enquired whether their hosts had any
money or garments worth stealing. Doubting
their negatives, they undressed them, and beneath
the monkish outer-garment which each one was
wearing discovered on the two travellers underclothing
which suggested riches. The Arabs forthwith
led all four away into the desert to sell them
at Medina, but were induced before long to despatch
the monk with two of themselves to the
nearest monastery, that of S. Saba, some hours'
journey from Jerusalem, for ransom. The remaining
three Franks, unarmed, chose their time to
attack the two armed Arabs, and after a desperate
fight and a fearful journey, wounded, parched,
and famished, Fürer climbed up a rope-ladder
into the monastery through one of the back-windows,
while the two other Arabs were being
kept waiting in the front.</p>

<p>The other tale concerns sixty-two pilgrims who
sailed from Jaffa in the August of that same
year.<a name="Anchor-149" id="Anchor-149"></a><a href="#Footnote-149" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 149.">[149]</a> On October 16 they were shipwrecked off
the coast of Asia Minor, one being drowned. On
landing six were killed, the rest taken prisoners,
a proportion of whom go to Rhodes. These are
urged to apostatise—in vain. They offer ransoms;
Frau Johanna of Antwerp three hundred
ducats [£540], Pastor Peter Villingen three hundred
and twelve kronen [which may mean anything
from £200 to £800; probably the former]:
the total came to three thousand, two hundred and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>sixty kronen. This does not seem enough to their
owners; the Venetian and some sailors get free
somehow; the others are sent to the galleys. During
1566 Frau Johanna and six others die. By
May 1, 1568, seven more are dead; two have been
redeemed for six hundred kronen; two others for
four hundred and eighty kronen. Soon after, an
Italian was ransomed by the Venetian "bailo."
This is all that is known of the sixty-two.</p>

<div class="caption">A SOUVENIR</div>
</div>

<p>Another risk that was greater on the Jerusalem
journey was that of disease, or enfeeblement
through hardship. The state of things normal in
the Church of the Holy Sepulchre must alone
have told on health; one German on his return to
Jaffa counted two hundred and thirty lice in his
clothes. But, throughout, disease lay in wait for
all in a deadlier form than any we meet with.
Just as instead of "nerves" they suffered from
"inflammation of the conscience," so, instead of
influenza, they had plague, infectious in the highest
degree and fatal in a few days, or quicker. In
Constantinople it was looked on as inevitable and
raged unhindered. Yet, says Blount, the Turks'
carelessness was less of a hindrance to trade than
the Christians' precautions. In Venice, over the
doors of the inn-bedrooms was written "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Ricordati
della bolletta</span>"—"Remember your bill of
health." This "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">bolletta</span>," or "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">bolletina</span>," also
known as "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">fede</span>" or "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">patente</span>," had to be obtained,
before entering Venice, from the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">commissari</span>"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>or "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">soprastanti della sanità</span>," certifying
freedom from plague; failing which, or if a
"<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">fede</span>" obtained elsewhere was not "clean," <i>i. e.</i>
not bearing the official counter-signatures guaranteeing
freedom from plague at the last stopping-places,
the new-comer had to "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">far la contumacia</span>,"
go into quarantine for forty days. The disinfectants
consisted of sun, air, and vinegar, and the
confinement, if not on board ship, was in a spot
chosen for its pleasant healthiness, under shelter
which was clean, roomy, and well furnished, with
a broad verandah on which one's belongings were
to be laid out. This practice was constant at
Venice, where ships were always arriving from
plague-stricken ports; in the rest of Italy it was
frequent but intermittent. Outside Italy a
plague-scare occurred more rarely. When it did
the healthy but tired wayfarers might find themselves
shut out of the town where they looked to
find food and rest; perhaps would find the highway
itself barricaded<a name="Anchor-150" id="Anchor-150"></a><a href="#Footnote-150" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 150.">[150]</a> by the authorities of a
town which was plague-free and determined to
remain so, and forced to ride all night by dark
and dangerous by-ways<a name="Anchor-151" id="Anchor-151"></a><a href="#Footnote-151" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 151.">[151]</a>—unless they pretended
to be an ambassador and his retinue, as some
English merchants once did.</p>

<p>Too much stress must not be laid on the troubles
of a stranger who fell ill of a less deadly illness.
Perhaps, even, a German with the toothache
might still have the same experience in Spain as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>did a countryman of his three hundred years ago.
Having tried a cupping-glass himself in vain, he
went to the local barber-surgeon; the latter dug
the tooth out with a bread-knife! Yet in hospitals
a change for the better can be easily proved.
The chief hospital at Paris, the Hôtel-Dieu, was
visited by an Italian<a name="Anchor-152" id="Anchor-152"></a><a href="#Footnote-152" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 152.">[152]</a> in the middle of the seventeenth
century. Three or four men lay in each
bed, or two women; and the stench was terrible,
even to a seventeenth-century nose. At the galley-slaves'
hospital at Marseilles, a boy went in front
of visitors with a "pan of perfume." Still more to
the point, regarding this particular period, was
the predicament of a man at the point of death
in a district with a different theological stamp
from his own, say, a Protestant in a Roman Catholic
country. He would then have the choice of
accepting the sacrament in the locally orthodox
form or confessing himself a Protestant. In the
latter case the priest might cut the heretic off
from the help, not only of the doctor, but of the
cook also, and if he recovered in spite of this, the
Inquisition might be awaiting him. And yet a
man of average morality would be far less of an
adiaphorist in the sixteenth century than to-day.
Some Protestants at Venice resigned themselves
at death to the only cemetery-burial—that with
Roman Catholic rites; but most chose to be buried
at sea off Malamocco, trusting in the phrase,
"And the sea shall give up its dead."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>
<p>As to the "sudden death" of which the Litany
speaks, if one regards direct evidence only, there
may well be a tendency to think the risk of it
somewhat exaggerated, but the balance will recover
itself if, to the number of travellers who
have left us record of their doings, is added that
of the dead men who would have told tales if they
could. Mile after mile of loneliest road had to
be slowly traversed, many a mile through forest
where now is open ground, at a time when existed
far less force in conventions to restrain those,
perhaps even more numerous then than now,
like the murderers of Banquo:—</p>

<p>In the towns, the narrow dark streets gave the
assassin his opportunity, whether a mistaken one
or not. Readers of Cellini's autobiography will
recall his remark that he trained himself to turn
corners wide and may have noted it as merely
characteristic; but before Cellini's book was in
print, we find the French tourist, Payen of Meaux,
writing of the Venetians, "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Quand ils marchent</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la nuit, ils ne tournent jamais court pour entrer
dans une Rue; mais ils tiennent le milieu, afin
d'éviter la rencontre de ceux qui voudroient les
attendre</span>."</p>

<p>Supposing, however, that a foreigner died in
peace, what happened to the money and chattels
with him at the moment? According to Zeiler,
in Aragon the practice was to notify the authorities
at his native place and hold the goods at the
disposal of the legal heirs for a year, after which
limit unclaimed property was handed to the
Brotherhood of Our Lady of Pity to be employed
in the redemption of captives. In Rome the custom
was for the servant to take the dead master's
clothes. In France the State took absolutely
everything by the "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">droit d'aubaine</span>," which was
the law wherever feudalism had established itself,
though sometimes in abeyance; in Poland it
seems to have been completely so.<a name="Anchor-153" id="Anchor-153"></a><a href="#Footnote-153" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 153.">[153]</a> The strictness,
on the contrary, with which it was enforced in
France is well illustrated by the fate of the library
of Sir Kenelm Digby, who died at Paris in 1665.
It was forfeited to Louis <abbr title="the fourteenth">XIV</abbr> by the "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">droit
d'aubaine</span>"; he gave it away; the new owner sold
it to a relative of the late owner for ten thousand
crowns.</p>

<p>This right, based as it was on the same "right
to pillage" under which the Jews suffered in the
Middle Ages,<a name="Anchor-154" id="Anchor-154"></a><a href="#Footnote-154" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 154.">[154]</a> brings out very clearly one fact
which was always liable to affect a traveller's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>finances, namely, that in so far as he was a traveller,
he had no legal privileges. Two Dutch
gentlemen,<a name="Anchor-155" id="Anchor-155"></a><a href="#Footnote-155" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 155.">[155]</a> for instance, were at Paris at a
time when war between Holland and France suddenly
became imminent. They found the financial
agents forbidden to pay them on bills of exchange
or letters of credit, and their goods were temporarily
confiscated. It was the ordinary procedure
of the time. Here again is obvious the advantage
of going in the train of an ambassador; the latter's
rights were the fullest protection that an alien
could acquire, except mercantile ones at their
best. Yet even these ambassadorial rights lacked
so much of the fullness and the clearness that
they possess to-day that they were not put forward
in a modern form, not even in theory, until
the treatise of Grotius on the subject published
in 1625.<a name="Anchor-156" id="Anchor-156"></a><a href="#Footnote-156" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 156.">[156]</a></p>

<p>These Dutch gentlemen just mentioned found
themselves in difficulties on their arrival in Paris
in another way also. They had introductions to
good society; fashions had changed while they
were en route; they must stay in their lodgings
till the tailor had done his worst. Even if they
had been going to Jerusalem they would still have
felt the relationship between cost and clothes,
a relationship decidedly closer then than at present.
Only in going to Jerusalem it took this form,
that the shabbier you went the less the journey
cost. As to kind, preferably such as were worn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>by Greeks, friars, merchants, or Syrian Christians.

<p>was no protection against suspicion of riches.
Yet it was supposed to lessen the risk of being
kidnapped into slavery at Algiers on the road to
Montserrat if one carried the white pilgrim's
staff.</p>

<p>Crossing the Alps, for a northerner who did not
wish to be conspicuously alien, meant a complete
change into black silk; for the brilliant attire
which we see in productions of "Romeo and
Juliet" reflects Elizabethan England, not Italy.
Italy manufactured those multi-coloured materials,
it is true, but for export or official use only,
except for the ash colour that betokened a vow
not perfected.</p>

<p>Typical minor incidents were the purchasing
of a new handkerchief in Germany, of light-coloured
silk, and, as to size, somewhat resembling
a saddle-cloth, with initials of some motto worked
in a corner thereof, say D. H. I. M. T. ("<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Der Herr</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">ist Mein Trost</span>") or W.H.I.B. ("<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Wie heilig
ist Bruderschaft</span>"), and secondly, the story of a
sugar-loaf hat. An Italian priest wore it in Italy—but
not in France. Before leaving Lyons he
had grown tired of a crowd of children following
him about. So far from being able to sell it, it
was impossible to find any one who would take it
as a gift until he met a man whose business was
partly selling a powder which killed mice. The
rest of his business was the profession of town-fool.
That being so, he could accept the hat; he
cut it into the shape of an imperial crown and
gave himself out as the Emperor of the Moluccas.</p>

<p>A complete change into French clothes cost
this priest two pistoles [£8], and he adds the detail
that nowhere was waterproof material to be
bought. The waxed cloth which was sold as such
cracked wherever it had been folded.</p>

<p>On occasion, too, changes of clothes might be
a legal obligation. The sumptuary laws might
step in and forbid the new-comer to wear what was
perhaps his one respectable garment. Or again,
in Muscovy, foreigners used to dress as natives
to avoid the jeers of the crowd; but at some date
early in the seventeenth century the Patriarch
noticed Germans behaving irreverently at a festival
and complained that foreigners ought not to
seem included in the benediction that was given
to the faithful. Foreigners were therefore ordered
to revert to their national dress, which produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>most ludicrous results until the tailors could finish
new garments; inasmuch as the merchants had
to fall back on those that had belonged to their
predecessors, leaving sometimes a whole generation
between the fashions of their upper and
nether garments.</p>


<p class="mt2">All these things might fall on the tourist: each
one cost money; some one, at least, of them he
would hardly escape. One more source of possible
loss existed, one that he was certain to have to
face—the money itself. The variety of coins was
just as great as the variety of clothes, though with
this difference that the clothes were as local as the
coins were international—just the opposite of
the case to-day. This is not equally true, of course,
of all denominations, and the majority may not
have circulated so freely as in preceding centuries,
but the higher ones seem to have passed about
from hand to hand with little more hesitation
than Australian sovereigns do in England. When
exceptions occurred, they generally had political
causes: French gold, for example, being more
willingly taken by the Swiss than other foreign
gold because they had become so used to it in the
course of serving as French mercenaries.</p>

<p>Of the uncertainties of the tourist, however,
in relation to coins, that caused by their international
character would be the first to disappear.
There remained a trinity of diversities to bewilder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>him permanently and to deliver him over, defenceless,
to the dishonest: diversity of value,
diversity of kind, diversity of inscription.</p>

<p>To take the last first; it might seem that absence
was a more appropriate term than diversity,
seeing that the nominal value of a coin in circulation
about 1600 was only in the smallest percentage
of cases stated on its face; and when
one comes to think of it, it is only the tourist
who ever reads a coin for business purposes.
Where the diversity comes in lies in the fact
of certain names becoming popular, such as
"paolo" in Italy, which meant that many different
types would be struck, all "paoli" but none
alike. As to variations in value these may be
illustrated from the Venetian zecchino, the Hungarian
ducat, the sultanon of Constantinople and
the sheriff of Cairo. All of these are reckoned as
equal in one year or other between 1592 and 1620
by one or other trustworthy traveller, yet the
differences of value of one coin or other of the
four vary from 6s. 8d. to 9s.; and this was not a
steady rise. In fact, the difference between the 1592
and 1620 valuations is but fourpence. Moreover,
the settlement of values was far less a commercial
affair merely than it has become; governments
were forever tinkering at it by means of proclamations,
all telling against the tourist, since their
object was to attract, or to retain, bullion, which
either depreciated the value of the coin he wished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>to change or appreciated that of the coin he had
to acquire. Lady Fanshawe mentions a proclamation
of October 14, 1664, at Madrid which cost
her husband, ambassador there, eight hundred
pounds. Since then, paper money has come to
absorb all the political dishonesty that used to be
exercised on coins, and the far less abrupt modern
methods minimise the loss to the tourist. The
French government went bankrupt fifty-six times
during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<a name="Anchor-157" id="Anchor-157"></a><a href="#Footnote-157" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 157.">[157]</a></p>

<p>As to the other diversity, that of kind, Lauder
saw a proclamation which assessed the values of
five hundred coins then current in France.</p>

<p>The whole of the above refers mainly to gold
and the higher denominations of silver. Yet these
more important coins were a simple matter compared
with small change, especially in Italy; for
when the tourist had been confronted with soldi,
grossi, giuli, paoli, reali, quattrini, susine, denari,
cavallotti, cavallucci, carlini, bagatini, bolignei,
baocchi, baelli, etc., he could not but feel relieved
when, crossing the Alps, he had only to face Swiss
plapparts and finfers and the German batz,
kreutzer, stiver, copstück, sesling, pfennig, and
not many more. The grosch perhaps ought to be
mentioned as well if only for the fact that Taylor,
the "water-poet," when at Hamburg, noticed
that among twenty-three groschen he had in his
pocket there were thirteen varieties, owing to the
number of local mints. He valued all these at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>twopence each, but as a matter of fact groschen
varied so greatly that to give one away might be
either extravagance or an insult. There were, of
course, many multiples of these denominations,
and besides coins, tokens innumerable, all having
but this in common that when one had gone a few
miles further they would not be taken in payment.
They might be made of base metal, like that of
the famous "Mermaid" tavern which is preserved
at the "birthplace" at Stratford-on-Avon, or of
leather, or almost anything else solid.</p>

<p>In Muscovy were no native coins but silver,
and those so small that the Muscovites used to
keep dozens in their mouths because they slipped
through their fingers—and that without incommoding
their speech. In Spain,<a name="Anchor-158" id="Anchor-158"></a><a href="#Footnote-158" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 158.">[158]</a> so far as there
was any standard, it was the Castilian real, which
you might exchange for thirty-four Castilian
maravedis, forty Portuguese rais, thirty-six Valencian
dineros, twenty-four Aragonese, and thirty-eight
Catalonian dineros. But these Portuguese
coins would not be taken in Castile, nor the
Castilian in Valencia, nor Valencian anywhere
out of Valencia. Along the chief merchants' road
in Spain, from Barcelona, you might go one hundred
miles, as far as Lerida, and find every place
with a different minor coinage, current there only,
and in Barcelona one was especially liable to receive
coins which no one, not even in Barcelona,
would accept.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>
<p>On the Jerusalem journey the higher payments
were reckoned in foreign money usually, the
Italian gold zecchini and silver piastri most frequently;
smaller ones in brass meidines of Tripoli
or of Cairo, equal to about a penny farthing and
twopence respectively, or in aspers, about three
farthings.</p>

<p>Just as, further, the tourist could examine a
coin without being able to find out its nominal
value, could ascertain the latter and still be ignorant
of its real value, so, too, he was continually
having to pay reckonings in coins which did not
exist. The Venetian and Spanish ducat, the German
gulden, the French livre tournois, the Muscovite
rouble, and, later, their altine also, were
coins of account only. All these coins were as
commonly used in daily business in their own
localities as guineas are in English charities; and
the ducat and the gulden far outside them. In
the seventeenth century the Spanish pistole was
actual coin in its own country and coin of account
in France; board and lodging on "pension" terms
would be reckoned in pistoles in Paris. In fact,
the French equivalent for "rolling in riches,"
"cousu de pistoles," is equally evidence of the
international character of seventeenth-century
gold and of the method of carrying it.</p>


<p class="mt2">The tourist in 1600 has done his touring. His
money is spent; his pleasure is buried; his wisdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>gathered; and the fruit is ours. And now; was the
pleasure worth the money? was the wisdom worth
the gathering?</p>

<p>The answer is, most emphatically, Yes!—Yes
for them, and Yes for us. But as to the latter
question there were two answers then, and the
subject has suggestions beyond those that have
come up so far. Let us look at this adverse opinion,
and one or two of the suggestions.</p>

<p>During the sixteenth century it became a convention
to abuse travel, especially travel in Italy;
a convention which may have been more fruitful
in England than elsewhere, but certainly was not
so to the exclusive extent which modern books in
English seem to imply. The difficulty would be
to find a nation whose literature at this time does
not contain examples of it; even in Poland, where
of all places travel was most taken for granted,
this topic was one of the first to be dealt with
when the vernacular was turned to literary account,
namely, in the satires of Kochanowski.
When examined, these invectives turn out to have
won more attention than they are entitled to,
written as they generally are, especially in England,
by the class whose medium is nowadays the
half-penny paper or the 'religious' novel. We find
among their authors all the familiar figures, from
the hack-journalist who parades a belated morality
for the sake of his stomach down to the bishop
to whom the subject, when worn rather thin, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>revealed as a brand-new dummy-sin. It is curious
that this very bishop, Joseph Hall, should in describing
his own journeys, unconsciously provide
the most clear-cut sketch of how not to travel that
has, perhaps, ever been written.<a name="Anchor-159" id="Anchor-159"></a><a href="#Footnote-159" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 159.">[159]</a> If, among these
types, we miss the retired colonel, we must remember
that the title was so recently invented,
the times so bloody, that all the colonels were
probably either fighting or dead. At any rate, the
interest of this type of pamphlet belongs rather to
the history of publishing than to that of travel, as
dating the time when publishers first discovered
what a paying public can be created among the
lower levels of Puritanism. The proportion of fact
that gave them a starting-point may best be put
in perspective by pointing out the parallel that
exists between travel in Italy three hundred years
ago and modern motoring. Nobody who could
afford it went without; everybody who could not
afford it abused everybody who did; it killed some,
maimed others, benefited most, and brightened
the life of many a poor rich man who otherwise
would have departed this life little better off mentally
than his own cows. These pamphleteers
were committing the fundamental error of allowing
their attention to be absorbed by the seven
eighths of foolishness that characterises everything
human instead of concentrating it on the
other eighth which provides the justification as
well as the driving-force. For a sober, all-round,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>view of the question as it appeared to a man who
was both man of the world and scholar, one cannot
do better than turn to a letter written by Estienne
Pasquier, a letter of introduction for a son of
Turnebus. "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Comme il a l'esprit beau, aussi lui
est-il tombé en teste, ce qui tombe ordinairement
aux âmes les plus généreuses, de vouloir voyager
pour le faire sage.... S'il m'en croit, il se contentera
de voir l'Italie en passant; car ce que
Pyrrhus Neoptolemus disoit de la Philosophie,
qu'il falloit philosopher, mais sobrement, je le
dy du voyage d'Italie, à tous nos jeunes François
qui s'y acheminent par une convoitise de voir.</span>"<a name="Anchor-160" id="Anchor-160"></a><a href="#Footnote-160" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 160.">[160]</a></p>

<p>Yet there is one defect of their travels which
necessarily escaped notice at the time but cannot
fail to strike any one now, which is, how much
they passed by without a glance. It is commonly
thought that the contrast of travel in days gone
by with that of the later times is one of leisureliness
as against universal effort to go "faster,
farther, and higher" than one's neighbour. But
the truth is that in what essentially characterises
leisureliness in travelling, the leaving time and
energy free for enjoying and studying places on
the road, and still more, off it, they were more
wanting than we. They went the greatest pace
they could; where they stopped at the night they
left at dawn; and overnight they had been too
tired to explore amid the filth, the dangers, the
darkness, the inextricable confusion, of a sixteenth-century
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>town or hamlet. Yet if you call to mind
the towns seen in passing which you recollect most
vividly, most will probably be those in which your
first walks happened after dark. And is there any
Gothic cathedral, however grand, whose outside
is not commonplace by day compared to its glory
by night?</p>

<p>Moreover, the dearth of information narrowed
not their opportunities merely, but their interests
likewise. Carnac and Stonehenge were no doubt
a long way out of their way, but the dolmen of
Bagneux was no more than three-quarters of a
mile from Saumur, where many of them stayed
for weeks, or even months. Yet not a single one,
apparently, went to see it. As for the opportunities,
not only was Pompeii still buried for them,
but Rome itself was, as Montaigne says, not so
much ruins as a sepulchre of ruins. When, again,
some one says of Lyons that the houses are fine
but the streets so ill-smelling and dirty that one
cannot stop to admire them, it may remind us
that much that was nominally visible was practically
invisible; whether through being what was,
to them, a considerable distance off their routes,
like Brou or Laon, or, as with most cathedrals,
through houses being built up against them.
Similarly, the Roman amphitheatre at Nîmes is a
case in point; houses having been erected inside
it so freely that in 1682 five hundred men capable
of bearing arms were supposed to be dwelling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>there.<a name="Anchor-161" id="Anchor-161"></a><a href="#Footnote-161" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 161.">[161]</a> And along with these conditions of living
went ideas to correspond; the total effect being
half-prohibitive of the occupations of the artist,
the historian, and the archæologist, and this at a
period when a larger proportion of the greatest
buildings of Europe coexisted than at any other
period. In fact, so far as the Loire châteaux are
concerned, it is clear that the modern tourist sees
far more of some of the finest Renascence work
than did its contemporaries, who were restricted
here to a visit to Chambord and a glimpse of the
outsides of Blois and Amboise.</p>

<p>But after all deductions of this kind have been
granted, they may well reply that their concern
was not so much with that part of the present
which we term the past, but with that which we
term the future, their individual futures, in particular;
and that their object was achieved; adding,
moreover, that travel under these conditions
was certainly superior to travel of the twentieth
century, considered as a form of education in the
wider sense of the word. For not only was it
obligatory to share the life of the country and its
language to an extent which is optional now, but
a traveller was continually being thrown on his
own resources and presence of mind in matters
which concerned his self-respect, his health, and
his safety, whereas now everything is merely a
matter of cash.</p>

<p>Turning to the benefit to us in day-by-day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>matters accruing from their experience abroad,
so many instances have already shown themselves
that the burden of proof falls on the other side;
whether, that is, any contemporary effort worth
making, any contemporary achievement to which
we are indebted, has not been in some degree fashioned
and vitalized by influences due to travel.<a name="Anchor-162" id="Anchor-162"></a><a href="#Footnote-162" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 162.">[162]</a> If
one further instance, typical of much else, is to be
chosen, it may be pointed out how almost everything
that contributes to the material attractions
of Dublin is due to those who, in exile on the Continent,
saw the gain that lay in planning a city
finely. Further still, their knowledge of languages,
acquired at a time when vernaculars were coming
into their own, resulted in an infusion into each
vernacular of the additions it needed to assimilate
to enable it to fulfil its potentialities for the purposes
both of every-day life and of life at its best.
It is curious and significant that the Pole who has
just been quoted as an opponent of travel, Kochanowski,
learnt the value and, one might even
say, the possibility, of using the vernacular as
a medium of literature from associating with
members of the "Pléiade" in France.</p>

<p>Far above these and the rest; far outweighing,
too, all imaginable drawbacks, was the value of
the central idea, that of taking those who were
to enjoy the widest opportunities of usefulness
and influence, and bringing them, when their conscious
receptivity was at its highest, into personal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>contact with the whole of that world in which,
for which, and with which, their lives were to be
spent. That was its value at that time. But it
had a future as well as a present value, inasmuch
as the results of the system were cumulative, more
especially in so far as it served the purpose of
bringing these younger men into touch with the
best teachers and those older men of the finest
achievements, to gain acquaintance with whom
was always insisted on as an object second to
none in importance. As Bacon said, these travellers
were "Merchants of Light." They contributed
a definite share towards strengthening
and widening what is the only effective agency
of real advance in civilisation, "that better world
of men," of which the contemporary poet Daniel
was reminded by the "Essays" of Montaigne.</p>

(1562-1619; in "Musophilus").</p>


<p>The literature of the subject as a whole is absolutely
inexhaustible, the contemporary part alone being sufficient
to provide anyone with recreation—and sleep—for ten
years. Including a few whose accounts I have had to read
in translation, or even in paraphrase (such as that of
Bisoni mentioned below), the number of travellers on
whose evidence I have drawn first-hand amounts to over
two hundred and thirty; but this number could certainly
be doubled, perhaps trebled, by any one who found it
practicable to devote to the subject all the time and
money it could employ, inasmuch as there are probably
few libraries of long standing which do not contain a
manuscript account of a journey at this period; some
contain them by the dozen. Besides this, there are many
printed accounts little less inaccessible than most manuscripts.
The most convenient library for consulting contemporary
editions of these printed narratives is Marsh's
Library, Dublin, where one set of shelves is given up to
them; there they will be found by the score, besides
having a sub-heading ("Itinera") to themselves in the
catalogue.</p>

<p>This appendix, therefore, can concern itself with nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>but actual accounts of journeys, and that only in
some abbreviated form. The method followed is this.
First comes a list of the MSS. that I have been able to obtain
the opportunities to read (very few, unfortunately);
then another list, of printed books, consisting of those
which are bibliographies or serve as such, and of accounts
of journeys not mentioned in these bibliographical works:
together with some notes on certain recent editions of
books which are there mentioned.</p>

<p>Asterisks indicate bibliographies; square brackets, books
my knowledge of which is second-hand: while, in order
to obviate needless suffering on the part of any who may
feel inclined for a little further acquaintance with these
accounts, the names of the authors of the more readable
are printed in heavier type. It may as well be said that the
value of most of these narratives consists simply in their
having been written three hundred years ago.</p>

<p>The second list is one of authors' names, but topographical
guidance is provided in the index by means of the
abbreviation "<span class="smcap">Bibl</span>"[iography] added as a sub-heading
to place-names, followed by the names of the authors who
are of assistance with regard to that place; <i>e. g.</i>:—</p>

<p>
"<b>Spain</b>"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="smcap">Bibl.</span>: Wynn.</span><br />
</p>

<p>After such names will sometimes be found numbers; these
refer back to the Table of Special References. It is taken
for granted that every one of these bibliographical books
will be recognized as adding information about many countries,
since however strictly the scope of each may be
limited, it will include travellers who came from, and
went in, all directions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_b_390fp"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_390fp.jpg" width="400" height="476" alt="A SCHOLAR TRAVELLER" />
<div class="caption">A SCHOLAR TRAVELLER</div>
</div>

<p>References to accounts, generally fragments, which
have appeared in periodical form only, have had to be
restricted to the more interesting; most of which are to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>be found in the Table of Special References. For further
sources not indicated in detail, bibliographies of national
history, correspondence, biographies, records of embassies
and prefaces to the last-named, especially to the Venetian
"Relazioni" edited by Barozzi and Berchet, have all
proved particularly useful. All the later publications of
the Historical MSS. Commission (the earlier contain indications
of MSS. in private hands, but no more than the
titles are given) and all the Calendars of State Papers
which include the required years, have been examined up
to the end of the publications for 1908, at least.</p>

<p>As to non-contemporary sources of information, I have
used them only for negative purposes—to decide which
of two travellers is the bigger liar, for instance; or to avoid
displaying more ignorance than is necessary on those
elementary points of geography which everybody is supposed
to know and nobody does; etc., etc. Some exceptions
to this procedure seemed reasonable; but these are
made obvious. Any statement of objective fact, indeed,
seems to me impracticable in connection with such a subject
as this. My aim has been merely at approximate subjective
accuracy; to study, that is, the psychology of the
subject, conscious and sub-conscious; and its phenomena
only in so far as they are causes of, or symbolize, the psychology.
Students are requested to hear this statement
with the ear of faith, remembering that all such attempts
have to be heavily peptonized if expenses are to be paid,
as this one's must be, by those in whom the spirit indeed is
willing but the digestion weak. And even students—!</p>

<p>But when all limitations of aim have been granted, it
must be admitted further that a summary of the experiences
and thoughts of scores of individuals, and of the
thousands they stand for, over a period of more than a
century and extending over all one continent and into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>fractions of two others, must be mainly remarkable as an
anthology of half-truths.</p>

<p>Further still, to those who may notice that the half-truths
are less stereotyped, the detail less hackneyed, than
might have been the case, I should like to say that the
credit of that is largely due to the London Library, without
which this book would probably not have seemed
worth writing or worth publishing; and that my debt is by
no means only to the books and to the librarian's readiness
to add to them, but also to the exceptional ability, and
equally exceptional willingness, of the staff to help. It is
only fair to mention, too, in speaking of bibliographical
assistance, how much I am indebted to that furnished in
the numbers of "Revue Historique." Acknowledgments
are also due to the owners of the originals of the illustrations.
No trouble has been spared to make the book the
best illustrated existing for the period dealt with, with the
necessary exception of the two quarto volumes of Van
Vaernewyck's "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mémoires d'un Patricien Gantois</span>"; all
the photographs have been specially taken (except that of
Rabelais' receipt) from the best procurable originals, often
unique ones. For translations and information from Polish
sources my sincere thanks are due to members of the
Polish Circle in London, Mr. A. Zaleski in particular; and
for help in various ways, which includes encouragement,
to many others, especially Mr. Hubert Hall and Professor
Gollancz, and, most of all, to my wife.</p>

<p>Lansdown, 720. The frequent references to this MS.
will have shown how useful it is. Among many other
points that give it value are the excellent drawing of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>bust of Petrarch at Arqua, soon afterwards destroyed,
and a copy of the subsequently effaced epitaph of
Clément Marot at Turin (fol. 37 b). The MS. is anonymous,
but the author may be identified as Nicolas Audebert
(1556-98), son of Germain Audebert. Beckmann
(q. v.) had already established the identity of
"le sieur Audeber," whose "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Voyage et Observations en
Italie</span>" were published at Paris in 1656, with Nicolas
Audebert, and that the author of the printed book is
the same as he who wrote the MS. is suggested by the
relations of both with Aldrovandi (MS. fol. 101 b).
More definite evidence is obtainable from an article
on Nicolas in the Revue Archéologique (3rd series, vol.
10, pp. 315-322), by means of the dates on his letters
written from Italy. In view of this identification it may
be worth mentioning that the author's birthday was
April 25 (fol. 558) &amp; that he was elected "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">president de
l'Université</span>" of Bologna in Nov. 1575 (fol. 86 b), a year
in which the name of the rector has not hitherto been
known.</p>

<p>Sloane, 4217. A honeymoon trip, a pilgrimage, &amp; a

birth to a still-born child at Padua, &amp; there died.</p>

The long introduction on Spanish autobiographies
mentions many travellers of whose accounts
I have been able to make practically no use owing to
my not knowing of the book in time (see pp. 49, 50,
62, 63, 86, 89, 94, 97 (2), 109, 123, 124, 125, 142, 148;
and bibliography of Jerusalem pilgrims' accounts,
55-58). Several of these, however, exist only in MS.
in Spain. Great Britain &amp; Scandinavia receive little
attention, but plenty of valuable material seems to
be included for every other part of Europe; certainly
this is so in the narratives (16th-17th centuries)
which the author prints.</p>

<p class="hang">Sobieski, Jakób, Marshal of the Polish Diet, travelled

the missing portion by A. Kraushar (Warsaw, 1903)

Petersburg. The only part that seems to have

history can fail to be assisted by).</p>

<p class="hang"><b>Vargas</b>, Juan de, contemporary with Alonso de Guzman
&amp; Sastrow, both of whose narratives he supplements
very closely. As a soldier under Charles <abbr title="the fifth">V</abbr> in Germany,
his remarkable experiences illustrate the
present subject: he also saw the wildest life in Hungary
&amp; Vienna, &amp; slave-life in Constantinople &amp;
Africa. Still more remarkable were his experiences
in S. America as a "conquistador." His capacity for
telling us what we most want to know, &amp; for telling
it well, are so much beyond what might be expected
from an uneducated soldier as to raise doubts about
the genuineness of the narrative. But the abundance
of detail is past invention. It is unmentioned by
Serrano y Sanz; the only edition seeming to be the
French translation by the owner of the unpublished
Spanish MS., C. Navarin, "Les Aventures de Don
Juan de Vargas" in the Bibliothèque Elzévirienne,
1853.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>Wotton</b>, Sir Henry. For all references to Sir Henry Wotton
(&amp; for much else) I am indebted to his "Life &amp;
Letters" by L. P. Smith (1907). Both his life &amp; his
letters come into touch with the travel of the day from
various points of view, &amp; frequently; &amp; the same mellowness
&amp; intimacy characterize both the reminiscences
of Sir Henry Wotton &amp; the comment of his
biographer.</p>

<p class="hang">Wynn, Sir Richard, followed Prince Charles from England
to Spain in 1625. His account of his journey has
been printed by Hearne as an appendix to his edition

<p class="hang"><b>Zetzner</b>, Johann Eberhard, a descendant of the Strassburg
printers of that name, left an autobiography consisting
largely of accounts of his journeys in Germany,
along the coasts of the Baltic, in England, Scotland,
France, &amp; Spain. A paraphrase of the more interesting
parts has been printed in three instalments, in French,
in the "Revue d'Alsace" [1905-07?] and reissued
separately under the titles "Idylle Norvégienne d'un
Jeune Négociant Strasbourgeois" (1905), "Londres
et l'Angleterre en 1700" (1905), and "Un Voyage
d'Affaires en Espagne en 1718 (1907)," all published
by the Librairie Noiriel, Strassbourg, edited by Rodolphe
Reuss, who has put together in a very readable
form matter which is of considerable value not
only as a record of things seen, but also in connection
with finance &amp; commerce. In spite of the dates being
so much later than those of the rest of the books I
have used, it seems desirable to include these pamphlets
here as containing much that illustrates conditions
equally normal a century earlier, &amp; as being,
too, of such an out-of-the-way character that they
are liable to be overlooked.</p></div>
